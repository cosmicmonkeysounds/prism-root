# Current Plan

## Graph lens visual polish + pan/zoom fix + sitemap upgrade (Complete — 2026-04-14)

User reported that *"the Sitemap graph in Prism Puck is ugly as fuck"* and
*"the panning / zoom doesn't work in the graph view either"*. Two separate
but related problems in the xyflow binding.

### What landed

1. **Pan/zoom fix — shell slot fill.** Playwright DOM inspection showed the
   `.react-flow` ancestor chain collapsed to `h:0` because Puck's internal
   `SlotRender` wraps slot content in a `<div>` with no defaults, sitting
   between the `data-slot` grid area (h:964) and the graph panel that uses
   `height: 100%` (resolves to 0). Fix in `@prism/core/puck`
   `shell-components.tsx`: `resolveSlot(slot, slotProps?)` now forwards a
   `SLOT_FILL_STYLE = { width/height 100%, flex column, min-w/h 0 }` into
   the slot fn so the wrapper div inherits proper dimensions. Every
   `ShellRenderer` slot call passes `{ style: SLOT_FILL_STYLE }`.

2. **Themed xyflow nodes (`prism-graph.css`).** New CSS module colocated
   with `prism-graph.tsx`. Defines a `.prism-graph-themed` scope with CSS
   custom properties (node bg gradient, fg, accent, shadows), themes
   `.react-flow__*` primitives, and styles node cards with a left accent
   stripe via `::before`. Per-variant stripes: `.prism-node-default`
   (cyan), `.prism-node-codemirror` (violet), `.prism-node-markdown`
   (green), `.prism-node-sitemap` (cyan / amber for home). Dark minimap,
   dotted background (`gap:24, size:1.4`), arrow markers on every edge.
   `PrismGraph` auto-applies the `prism-graph-themed` class.

3. **`SitemapNode` custom node type.** `custom-nodes.tsx` adds
   `SitemapNodeComponent` + `SitemapNodeMemo` + `SitemapNodePrism` type
   and registers `sitemap: SitemapNodeMemo` in `prismNodeTypes`. Renders
   a header with either a `⌂` home glyph (amber) or `↪` arrow (cyan),
   title, and a `.prism-node-path` pill showing the URL path. Exported
   from `@prism/core/graph`.

4. **Sitemap panel uses elk auto-layout.** `sitemap-panel.tsx` dropped
   the hand-rolled `layoutNodes()` column/row grid. `writeGraph` creates
   `type: "sitemap"` nodes at `(0, 0)` with `data: { label, path, isHome }`,
   and `runInitialLayout(store)` runs `applyElkLayout` with direction
   `DOWN` before flushing the version bump so the first paint already
   shows nodes in their final positions. Three edge kinds map to the
   three `WireType`s: hierarchy→hard (solid cyan), navigation→weak
   (dashed slate), transition→stream (animated amber).

5. **`readNodes` GraphStore bug fix.** The Loro-backed graph store stored
   `data` via `JSON.stringify` but `readNodes` returned `list.toJSON()`
   verbatim — so consumers saw `n.data` as a string, not an object, and
   `{ ...n.data }` spread character-indexed keys instead of node fields.
   The graph panel never noticed because its default node type used
   `label: n.id` fallback; the new sitemap node exposed the bug because
   its label lives on `data`. `readNodes` now parses the JSON string
   back into a plain object before returning.

6. **Demo workspace seeds a Prism App with routes.**
   `builtin-initializers.ts` `demoWorkspaceInitializer` now creates a
   "Demo App" with six routes (Home/Dashboard/Tasks/Task Detail/Settings/
   About, with `parentRouteId` hierarchy and `homeRouteId` wired via
   post-create `updateObject`) plus a `behavior` calling
   `ui.navigate("/dashboard")` from Home so the transition edge flavor
   is exercised on first boot.

### Verification

- `pnpm typecheck` clean on `@prism/core` and `@prism/studio`.
- `pnpm test` — 4079 tests pass across 217 files.
- Playwright screenshots (`/tmp/prism-screenshots/after-*.png`) show:
  graph lens with 45 themed nodes + 12 edges in a proper elk layout,
  pannable/zoomable; sitemap lens with 6 labeled route cards + 3 edges,
  "⌂ Home" highlighted, path pills visible, minimap + controls themed.

## Unified Shell + extracted primitives (Complete — 2026-04-13)

Prism previously carried three different "shell" things: the core `AppShell`
Puck component (6 slots: activityBar/sidebar/header/main/inspector/footer,
3×4 grid, no resize), the studio `PageShellRenderer` (4 resizable bars, 3×3
grid), and a branded `AppShellRenderer` wrapper over PageShell. User feedback:
*"one Shell please - but also extract the primitives like Grid and
ResizeHandle out so that users can do their own thing if desired."*

### What landed

1. **`@prism/core/puck/shell-grid.tsx` — extracted grid primitive.** A pure
   `computeShellGrid()` helper plus a `ShellGrid` React component that lays
   out a six-region 3×4 shell (activityBar | topBar/leftBar/main/rightBar |
   bottomBar) with per-cell style overrides, overlay slot, fullscreen toggle,
   and `clampBar()` shared utility. Bars with no content collapse to 0px.

2. **`@prism/core/puck/use-resize-handle.tsx` — extracted drag primitive.**
   `useResizeHandle(initial, axis, direction, onCommit)` hook and the
   `<ResizeHandle>` visual element. The ADR-005 Phase A ref-based fix
   (axisRef/directionRef/onCommitRef/valueRef) lives here — previously
   inlined twice in two files, now single source of truth.

3. **`@prism/core/puck/shell-components.tsx` — unified `Shell` Puck
   component.** Replaces the core `AppShell` component with a single 6-slot
   `Shell` whose slot names (activityBar, topBar, leftBar, main, rightBar,
   bottomBar) match PageShell's naming. `SHELL_PUCK_CONFIG` + `SHELL_SLOTS`
   are the canonical exports; `DEFAULT_STUDIO_SHELL_TREE` now projects
   ActivityBar → activityBar, TabBar/Presence/UndoStatus → topBar,
   ObjectExplorer/ComponentPalette → leftBar, LensOutlet → main,
   InspectorPanel → rightBar. Old `AppShell*` exports removed — `"Never
   deprecate"`.

4. **Studio migration.** `studio-kernel.ts` registers `"Shell"` (was
   `"AppShell"`). `studio-shell.tsx` uses `SHELL_PUCK_CONFIG`.
   `layout-shell-renderers.tsx` keeps `PageShellRenderer` /
   `AppShellRenderer` as thin wrappers over the core `ShellGrid` +
   `useResizeHandle` primitives so the user-visible `page-shell` / `app-shell`
   palette entries still exist and the entity-puck-config switch still
   resolves. No fixture trees or stored data changed — the two entity type
   names are the only user-surfaced names, and both are preserved.

5. **Test migration.** New `shell-grid.test.ts` covers the core primitive.
   `shell-components.test.ts` rewritten for the unified `Shell` naming.
   `layout-shell-renderers.test.tsx` dropped its `computeShellGrid` block
   (now tested in core) and keeps the ADR-005 resize-commit regression
   tests. `studio-kernel-shell.test.ts` updated to assert `"Shell"` in the
   direct registry.

### Tests

All **4079** monorepo tests pass across **217** files. `pnpm lint`,
`pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm build` are all green.

### Takeaway

The primitives are now independently importable: a user who wants a custom
shell shape pulls `ShellGrid` + `useResizeHandle` + `ResizeHandle` directly
from `@prism/core/puck` and composes their own React tree. The canonical
`Shell` Puck component is one specific arrangement of those primitives.
`page-shell` and `app-shell` entity types still exist as user-visible
palette presets but share a single grid/resize code path.

## Puck widget builder DSL + unified registration (Complete — 2026-04-14)

The Studio layout builder was built on ~3000 lines of hand-wired Puck widget
configs inside `layout-panel.tsx` — 43 widgets each repeating the same three
layers of ceremony (`{ type: "text" } as Fields[string]` declarations, `(p["x"]
as string) ?? "default"` prop extraction, `<div data-testid="puck-X"
style={{margin:"4px 0"}}>` wrappers, inline `kernel.store.allObjects().filter`
queries). The user's directive: *"builder-ize these patterns. no legacy code
should remain."*

### What landed

1. **`kernel/widget-builder.tsx` — new 264-line DSL.** Exports `f.*` field
   helpers (`text`, `area`, `num`, `select`, `yesNo`, `showHide`, `stringBool`,
   `slot`) that return concrete `Fields[string]` so callers write
   `collectionType: f.text()` instead of seven lines of casts. `asBool`
   coerces the `"true"` | `true` | `"false"` mishmash from legacy radio
   serializations. `useKernelSelectedId` reads the currently-selected object
   id reactively via `useSyncExternalStore` — defined here (not imported from
   `kernel-context.tsx`) to avoid a `studio-kernel → entity-puck-config →
   kernel-context → studio-kernel` cycle. `widget()` takes a `WidgetSpec<P>`
   with `type` / `fields` / `defaults` / `render` / optional `query` + `bare`
   and returns a full `ComponentConfig` — it closes over the kernel, wraps
   the body in the standard `puck-X` div, handles the three query strategies
   (`none`, `by-prop`, `fixed`), and gives the render function a strongly-
   typed `ctx: { props, kernel, selectedId, objects, select, update, create }`.

2. **`kernel/entity-puck-config.tsx` — full rewrite, 2794 lines.** Every widget
   now lives in `buildWidgetTable(kernel)` as a declarative `widget()` call —
   43 entries spanning luau-block, popover, slide-panel, facet-view,
   spatial-canvas, data-portal, kanban, list, table, card-grid, report,
   calendar, chart, map, the 10 record-type widgets (tasks → capture-inbox),
   tab-container, columns, divider, spacer, the 6 form-inputs, stat, badge,
   alert, progress-bar, markdown, iframe, code-block, video, audio. Each
   widget shrank from ~40–50 lines to ~15–25 lines. Special-case entities
   (shells, button, card, image) still flow through `entityToPuckComponent`
   via small transformation helpers (`buildShellComponent`,
   `buildButtonComponent`, `buildCardComponent`, `buildImageComponent`,
   `buildRecordListComponent`). `buildEntityPuckComponents(kernel)` is the
   single external entry point — `studio-kernel.ts` calls it once at boot
   and `registerDirect`'s every entry onto `kernel.puckComponents`.

3. **`buildPuckRootConfig(kernel, getPageId)` — extracted.** The Puck
   document-root config (fields + defaults + render) that used to live inline
   inside `layout-panel.tsx`'s giant `useMemo<Config>` now lives next to the
   component builder. The `getPageId` thunk lets callers thread the currently-
   selected page in reactively so bar-resize commits target the right page.

4. **`panels/layout-panel.tsx` — stripped from 3072 lines to 554 (−2894).**
   Deleted the orphaned `entityToPuckComponent` / `BLOCK_STYLE_FIELD_IDS` /
   `buildStylePuckFields` / `attachStyleFieldsInPlace` / `PuckLuauBlockRender`
   / `PuckImageBlockRender` dead code left over from the old pipeline.
   Dropped ~35 renderer/type/custom-field imports that are only needed
   transitively through the registered components. The new `puckConfig`
   `useMemo` reads from `kernel.puckComponents.directNames()` + `getDirect()`
   and calls `buildPuckCategories` / `buildPuckRootConfig` — about 15 lines
   where the old `useMemo<Config>` was ~2200.

5. **Lazy MapWidgetRenderer to keep vitest node-environment happy.**
   `leaflet` touches `window` at module import time; now that
   `entity-puck-config` is in `studio-kernel`'s import graph, any test that
   imports `kernel/index.ts` would explode before my React.lazy wrap.
   `MapWidgetRenderer` is now a `lazy(() => import(...))` inside a
   `<Suspense>` — the map library only loads when the widget actually
   renders in a browser, and node-env tests never hit it.

### Tests

All **4080** monorepo tests pass across **216** files. Studio typechecks
cleanly; `pnpm build` builds.
### Takeaway

The builder pays for itself immediately: adding a new widget is a ~15-line
`widget()` call with typed props and no ceremony. The layout panel is now a
thin lens over the kernel registry — exactly the self-registering pattern
the prior session was pushing toward, with no duplication between panel-
local and kernel-global component maps.

---

## Graph lens UX pass — batteries-included PrismGraph + viewport persistence (Complete — 2026-04-13)

The graph view system in Prism Puck Builder was barebones — just a raw `ReactFlow`
over the GraphStore with no minimap, no controls, no toolbar, no layout actions,
and pan/zoom was reset every time the user switched tabs. Fleshed out top-to-bottom.

### What landed

1. **`@prism/core/lens` — new `ViewportCache` primitive.** `createViewportCache()`
   returns a zustand vanilla store keyed by arbitrary strings (convention: `"lens:<id>"`)
   that remembers `{ x, y, zoom }` tuples and survives tab switches. Generic enough
   to serve any scrollable/zoomable surface (graph, sitemap, schema-designer,
   timeline, spatial canvas, viewport3d). 10 tests cover get/set/clear/clearAll +
   subscriber notifications + entry isolation.

2. **`@prism/core/graph` — fleshed-out `PrismGraph` + new `GraphToolbar`.**
   - `PrismGraph` now ships Background (dots/lines/cross), Controls, MiniMap
     (pannable/zoomable/dark), a `toolbar` slot (any `ReactNode`, positionable in
     any Panel corner), `initialViewport` + `onViewportChange` for persistence,
     `onInit`, `onNodeClick`/`onCanvasClick`. Uses a conditional spread for
     `defaultViewport` vs `fitView` so xyflow doesn't complain about both being
     set (`exactOptionalPropertyTypes`).
   - Internal `ViewportBridge` component wires `useOnViewportChange` to the
     optional callback.
   - `GraphToolbar` is a ~180-line composite rendered inside a `<Panel>`: Fit /
     Zoom+ / Zoom- / Auto-Layout buttons using `useReactFlow()` and
     `applyElkLayout`. Supports a single "Re-layout" button or multi-direction
     variants; accepts a custom `title` ReactNode.

3. **`kernel.viewportCache` on `StudioKernel`.** `createStudioKernel` instantiates
   `createViewportCache()` alongside `shellStore` and exposes it on the kernel
   interface. Any lens can now read/write `kernel.viewportCache.getState()`
   without reaching into its own persistence.

4. **`panels/graph-panel.tsx` — full rewrite.** Replaced the hand-rolled 3-depth
   column layout with `buildGraphFromKernel` + `reconcileGraph` + `applyElkLayout`.
   First mount builds the store once and runs elkjs "DOWN" direction so nodes
   aren't stacked at (0,0). Subsequent kernel `onChange` events diff into the
   existing GraphStore via `reconcileGraph`, which deliberately skips position
   updates on existing nodes — user-dragged positions survive rebuilds. Uses
   `GraphToolbar` with a stats title (node/edge count) and persists pan/zoom via
   `kernel.viewportCache` under `VIEWPORT_KEY = "lens:graph"`. Bottom inspector
   strip shows the selected node with a "Select in tree" button that calls
   `kernel.select()`.

5. **`panels/graph-panel-data.ts` — pure-helper split.** Extracted
   `buildGraphFromKernel` and `reconcileGraph` out of `graph-panel.tsx` into a
   sibling `.ts` file (same pattern as existing `chart-data.ts` / `map-data.ts`).
   Without this split the test file's import chain drags in leaflet's
   `map-widget-renderer.tsx` via the kernel, which crashes at `window is not
   defined` in the node test env.

6. **`panels/sitemap-panel.tsx` + `panels/schema-designer-panel.tsx`.** Both
   migrated to the new `PrismGraph` feature set — minimap, background,
   controls, toolbar, and viewport persistence. Sitemap uses `"lens:sitemap"`;
   schema-designer uses `"lens:schema-designer"` with its own internal
   `ViewToolbar` (entities aren't GraphStore objects so it re-implements Fit /
   Zoom / Re-layout locally but shares the viewport-cache primitive + elkjs
   helper).

### Tests

- `viewport-cache.test.ts` — 10 tests (`@prism/core/lens`).
- `graph-panel.test.ts` — 10 tests against `graph-panel-data.ts`:
  `buildGraphFromKernel` (nodes per live object, soft-deleted skip, containment
  edges, dead parents, ObjectEdges, missing endpoints) +
  `reconcileGraph` (adds/removes, position preservation, edge churn).
- `@prism/core/graph` + `@prism/studio` typecheck clean (the 2 pre-existing
  `layout-panel.tsx` errors are unrelated and predate this work).

## Puck-shell unification — Studio chrome as an editable Puck tree (Complete — 2026-04-13)

The Studio shell is now a Puck `<Render>` tree owned by the kernel. Every piece of Studio chrome — ActivityBar, ObjectExplorer, ComponentPalette, TabBar, InspectorPanel, UndoStatusBar, PresenceIndicator — is a `ShellWidgetBundle` that self-registers into `kernel.puckComponents`. Lens bundles that opt in via `puck: { embeddable: true }` also drop straight into the registry, so a lens author can put their own panel into any shell slot with zero shell-side wiring. `createStudioKernel` accepts an optional `appProfile` to filter lens bundles (Flux/Cadence/Lattice-style focused apps) and an optional `shellTree` override so a profile can rearrange the entire Studio layout as Puck JSON.

### What landed

1. **`@prism/core/lens`** — added `LensPuckConfig`-shaped generic `TPuckConfig` parameter on `LensBundle` and a new sibling `ShellWidgetBundle<TComponent, TPuckConfig>` type for chrome-only widgets (no `LensManifest`). `installShellWidgetBundles({ bundles, componentMap })` mirrors `installLensBundles` but only touches the component map. Core stays React-free — the generic is opaque.
2. **`@prism/core/bindings/puck/lens-puck-adapter.tsx`** — `registerLensBundlesInPuck(bundles, registry)` + `registerShellWidgetBundlesInPuck(bundles, registry)`. Each bundle's `puck` config is converted to a Puck `ComponentConfig` (uses `createElement` rather than JSX so the render signature aligns with `PuckComponent<DefaultComponentProps>` and satisfies `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`). Lens bundles are only registered when `puck.embeddable === true`; the function returns a per-bundle result record with `{ name, registered, skipReason }` (`"no-puck" | "not-embeddable"`). Shell widgets default to embeddable. PascalCase names come from `kebabToPascal(bundle.id)`.
3. **`@prism/core/bindings/puck/shell-components.tsx`** — built-in `AppShell` and `LensOutlet` Puck components.
   - `AppShell` exposes six named slot fields — `activityBar`, `sidebar`, `header`, `main`, `inspector`, `footer` — plus per-bar size props (`activityBarWidth`, `sidebarWidth`, `inspectorWidth`, `headerHeight`, `footerHeight`). Pure `computeAppShellGrid()` helper returns the CSS grid template (3 rows × 4 columns with named areas; hidden regions collapse to `0px`).
   - `LensOutlet` renders the active lens via `useLensContext` + `useShellStore`, with a configurable `emptyMessage` field.
   - `LensZone` helper component scopes any subtree to a specific lens id.
   - `createDefaultStudioShellTree({ widgetIds? })` builds the default AppShell tree (ActivityBar, ObjectExplorer+ComponentPalette, TabBar+PresenceIndicator+UndoStatusBar, LensOutlet, InspectorPanel), with per-widget id overrides so an app profile can substitute e.g. `CustomInspector` into the inspector slot. `DEFAULT_STUDIO_SHELL_TREE` is the pre-built constant.
4. **`packages/prism-studio/src/components/chrome-bundles.tsx`** — `createBuiltinShellWidgetBundles()` returns seven ShellWidgetBundles wrapping the existing chrome components (activity-bar, tab-bar, object-explorer, component-palette, inspector-panel, undo-status-bar, presence-indicator). Each bundle's `puck.label` is set so the Puck field inspector shows a readable name.
5. **`packages/prism-studio/src/kernel/studio-kernel.ts`** — `createStudioKernel` grew three options (`shellWidgetBundles`, `appProfile`, `shellTree`) and three instance fields (`shellWidgets`, `puckComponents`, `shellTree` + `setShellTree` + `onShellTreeChange`). At boot the kernel:
   - Seeds `puckComponents` with `AppShell` and `LensOutlet` via `registerDirect`.
   - Filters lens bundles through the pure `filterLensBundlesForProfile(bundles, profile)` helper before install — returns every bundle when the profile is missing or has no `lenses` field, otherwise intersects by id in source order.
   - Installs filtered lens bundles via `installLensBundles` and auto-registers embeddable ones via `registerLensBundlesInPuck`.
   - Installs shell widget bundles via `installShellWidgetBundles` and auto-registers every one via `registerShellWidgetBundlesInPuck`.
   - Defaults `shellTree` to `DEFAULT_STUDIO_SHELL_TREE`; `setShellTree` notifies subscribers, `dispose()` clears listeners before unwinding bundles.
6. **`packages/prism-studio/src/components/studio-shell.tsx`** — rewritten as a ~20-line Puck consumer: `useSyncExternalStore` on `kernel.onShellTreeChange`, `useMemo`s a Puck `Config` from `kernel.puckComponents.buildComponents(...)`, and renders `<Render config={config} data={shellTree} />`. No more hand-coded sidebar/inspector wiring — the entire chrome layout lives in `kernel.shellTree`.
7. **`packages/prism-studio/src/App.tsx`** — passes `shellWidgetBundles: createBuiltinShellWidgetBundles()` into `createStudioKernel`; no other changes. Every other app in the monorepo that constructs its own kernel picks up the same mechanism for free.

### Status

- **4036 Vitest tests / 211 files passing** (+25 new: 6 lens-puck-adapter, 9 shell-components, 10 studio-kernel-shell).
- **All 7 packages typecheck clean** (`pnpm typecheck`, 33.7s).
- New tests cover: embeddable filtering, skip reasons, kebab→pascal naming, label/fields/defaultProps carry-through, shell widget default-on registration, AppShell grid templates + slot fields + defaults, `createDefaultStudioShellTree` shape + widget id overrides, `filterLensBundlesForProfile` across every branch, `createStudioKernel` shell wiring (registry seeding, default tree, shell-widget auto-registration, embeddable lens auto-registration, appProfile filtering, shell-tree subscribers).

### Deferred

- `shell-builder-panel.tsx` — a Glass Flip lens (Shift+H) for live-editing `kernel.shellTree` through the Puck editor. The underlying plumbing is now in place; only the panel UI is missing.

## Puck editor help & UX pass — Phase A + B (Complete — 2026-04-13)

ADR-005 tackles three things: (A) a stuck-cursor resize bug in `PageShellRenderer`, (B) porting the legacy Helm help system to `@prism/core/help`, (C) wiring it into the Puck editor.

### Phase A — resize commit bug (landed)

- `packages/prism-studio/src/components/layout-shell-renderers.tsx` — `useResizeHandle` now keeps `axis` / `direction` / `onCommit` / `value` in refs so the pointer-listener effect only depends on `[dragging]`. Previously a mid-drag re-render (from `setValue` → parent state → new `value` prop) re-ran the effect, detaching the old `pointerup` handler so the commit fired against a listener that had already been removed. Pointer now snaps on release.
- `layout-shell-renderers.test.tsx` — 5 tests covering `computeShellGrid` + two pointerup/pointercancel commit paths.

### Phase B — `@prism/core/help` (landed)

Seven files under `packages/prism-core/src/bindings/react-shell/help/`, exposed as `@prism/core/help`:

1. `types.ts` — `HelpEntry` (id / title / icon?:ReactNode / summary / docPath? / docAnchor?). Legacy `ComponentType` icon is now a plain ReactNode so callers don't pin an icon library.
2. `help-registry.ts` — module-local `Map` + `register` / `registerMany` / `get` / `getAll` / `search` / `clear`. Search is case-insensitive AND-word substring across `title + summary`.
3. `help-context.tsx` — `HelpProvider` + `useHelp()`, app provides `onOpenDoc(path, anchor?)` so the help system isn't tied to any backend.
4. `help-markdown.tsx` — `HelpMarkdown` renders via `parseMarkdown` + `parseInline` from `@prism/core/forms` — no private tokenizer (satisfies the "parsing goes through Prism Syntax" constraint). Groups consecutive `li`/`task`/`oli` into `<ul>`/`<ol>`, emits `id` + `data-anchor` on headings, handles all six inline token kinds including wiki-links. `slugify` exported for tests.
5. `help-tooltip.tsx` — portal-rendered popover, 380 ms show delay, 120 ms hide delay, 276 px wide. Module-level singleton `_dismissCallbacks` map ensures only one tooltip is visible at a time. Dismisses on Escape and capture-phase scroll.
6. `doc-sheet.tsx` — fixed right-side 640 px slide panel with backdrop. Caller passes `fetchDoc(path) => Promise<string>` so Studio can use bundled `?raw` Vite imports (Tauri/Capacitor friendly) and a server app can HTTP fetch. Anchor scroll via `data-anchor`/`id` lookup with `CSS.escape`.
7. `doc-search.tsx` — search input + result list over `HelpRegistry.search()`, `onPick` callback so an anchoring popover can close after selection.

`index.ts` barrel + `"./help": "./src/bindings/react-shell/help/index.ts"` in `packages/prism-core/package.json` exports.

### Tests

- `help-registry.test.ts` — 15 tests (register/registerMany/get/getAll/search/clear, AND-logic, case-insensitive, readonly array).
- `help-markdown.test.tsx` — 17 tests (slugify + BlockToken→React rendering for all 11 block kinds + inline tokens, list grouping, checkbox rendering).
- `layout-shell-renderers.test.tsx` — 5 tests (Phase A).
- Full repo suite: **4073 tests passing across 214 files**.

### Config

- `vitest.config.ts` — include pattern broadened to `packages/*/src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` (and coverage to match) so `.test.tsx` files are actually picked up by root `pnpm test`. Prior .tsx tests had been silently skipped.

### Phase C — Wire help into Puck editor (Complete — 2026-04-13)

- `packages/prism-studio/src/panels/puck-help-entries.ts` — 8 categories, ~50 components (12 flagship summaries + stubs), 6 style-field groups, 4 regions. Side-effect module imported from `layout-panel.tsx` so `HelpRegistry.registerMany(...)` runs at boot.
- `packages/prism-studio/docs/help/*.md` — 12 flagship markdown docs bundled via Vite `?raw` and fetched through `fetchHelpDoc`.
- `layout-panel.tsx` — wraps the panel in `<HelpProvider>`; Puck `overrides.componentItem` / `overrides.drawerItem` wrap palette entries in `<HelpTooltip>` using derived helpIds. Toolbar `?` button (`data-testid="layout-panel-help-button"`) toggles an absolutely-positioned `<DocSearch>` popover (`data-testid="layout-panel-help-search"`); selecting a result with `docPath` sets `docState` and renders `<DocSheet>` (Escape closes).
- `PuckComponentProvider` (ADR-004) extended with optional `helpId?: string`.
- Collateral shell-boot fix: `studio-shell.tsx` now binds `APP_SHELL_PUCK_CONFIG` as `config.root` via `puckConfigToComponentConfig` (bypassing the `AppShell` PascalCase collision between core's built-in shell and the user-facing `app-shell` entity def). `core/bindings/puck/shell-components.tsx` widened `AppShellProps` slots to `ReactNode | SlotFn` with a `resolveSlot` helper so Puck v0.20 slot callables render correctly.
- E2E: `packages/prism-studio/e2e/layout.spec.ts` adds `help button toggles the DocSearch popover` smoke test. 3/3 layout.spec tests passing.

## Admin Panels for Daemon / Relay / Studio (Complete — 2026-04-13)

All three Prism runtimes now ship live admin dashboards powered by `@prism/admin-kit`.

### What landed

1. **`@prism/admin-kit/html`** — `renderAdminHtml(options)` generates a self-contained HTML page with inline CSS/JS that polls a JSON endpoint and renders the admin dashboard. Used by Relay and Daemon. Exports individual widget renderers (`renderHealthBadge`, `renderMetricCard`, `renderUptimeCard`, `renderServiceList`, `renderActivityTail`).
2. **`createDaemonDataSource({ url })`** — new data source in admin-kit that talks to the daemon's HTTP transport. Tries `POST /invoke/daemon.admin` first, falls back to `/healthz` + `/capabilities`.
3. **Relay admin routes** (`/admin`, `/admin/api/snapshot`) — mounted in `relay-server.ts`, outside `/api/*` (no CSRF). SSR seed data for instant first paint. Shows health, uptime, modules, peers, federation, collections, portals, memory.
4. **Daemon admin module** (`admin_module.rs`) — `daemon.admin` command returning `AdminSnapshot` JSON. No feature gate. Installed last in `with_defaults()` to capture all modules. Builder exposes `.with_admin()`.
5. **Daemon HTTP admin routes** (`/admin`, `/admin/api/snapshot`) — added to the axum HTTP transport (`transport-http` feature). HTML served via `include_str!` templates.
6. **Studio admin panel** — already existed (Shift+A lens), documented in Studio CLAUDE.md.
7. **Unit tests** — 26 HTML renderer tests, 4 daemon data source tests, 5 relay admin route tests, 3 Rust admin module tests, 2 Rust HTTP admin tests = 40 new tests, all passing.
8. **E2E tests** — `packages/prism-relay/e2e/admin.spec.ts` (4 tests: HTML page, JSON snapshot, browser render, auto-refresh), `packages/prism-studio/e2e/admin.spec.ts` (4 tests: activity bar switch, header/source picker, Puck widgets, tab bar).

### Test status

- Admin-kit: 89 Vitest tests across 9 files
- Relay admin routes: 5 Vitest tests
- Daemon: 5 Rust tests (3 admin module + 2 HTTP transport)
- Clippy clean under `--features transport-http`

## Puck component registry + RecordList primitive (In progress — 2026-04-13)

ADR-004 introduces a DI seam for Puck builder components so new widgets can flow through a registered `PuckComponentProvider` instead of a hand-wired `if (def.type === …)` block in `layout-panel.tsx`'s 3000-line config `useMemo`. The first consumer is `RecordList` — a parametric list over kernel records driven by `ViewConfig` (filter/sort/limit) plus a lightweight row template — which is intended to eventually subsume the ten dynamic record widgets plus `list-widget` / `table-widget` / `card-grid-widget` / `report-widget`.

### What landed

1. **`@prism/core/bindings/puck/component-registry.ts`** — `PuckComponentProvider<TKernel>` interface + `PuckComponentRegistry<TKernel>` class with `register` / `registerAll` / `unregister` / `has` / `get` / `types` / `buildComponents`. Generic over kernel type so core stays decoupled from studio. Emits PascalCase Puck keys from kebab-case entity types.
2. **`record-list` entity** in `packages/prism-studio/src/kernel/entities.ts` — `component` category, `childOnly: true`, fields for `recordType`, `titleField`, `subtitleField`, `metaFields`, `filterExpression`, `sortField`, `sortDir`, `limit`, `emptyMessage`.
3. **`RecordListRenderer`** (`packages/prism-studio/src/components/record-list-renderer.tsx`) — pure renderer taking pre-resolved `GraphObject[]` + `ViewConfig` + `RecordListTemplate`, applying `@prism/core/view`'s existing `applyViewConfig` pipeline, and rendering title/subtitle/meta chips. `readRecordField` helper handles all shell fields + data payload.
4. **`recordListProvider`** (`packages/prism-studio/src/panels/puck-providers/record-list-provider.tsx`) — parses the compact `filterExpression` grammar (`status eq open; priority in high,urgent`) into `FilterConfig[]`, the `metaFields` string into `TemplateField[]`, and queries the kernel for objects matching the selected `recordType`. Uses the existing 12 `FilterOp` values from `@prism/core/view` — no parallel spec.
5. **`createStudioPuckRegistry()`** — factory in `panels/puck-providers/index.ts` seeding a fresh registry with built-in providers. `layout-panel.tsx` calls it inside the existing config `useMemo` and merges its `buildComponents()` output over the hand-wired components (registry wins). Additive only — no existing widgets were migrated.
6. **Tests — 47 new, all passing**: 12 registry tests, 12 renderer tests (resolveTemplateField / applyRecordListView), 23 provider tests (parseFilterExpression, parseMetaFields, buildTemplate, buildViewConfig).
7. **ADR-004 drafted** — `docs/adr/004-puck-component-registry-and-dynamic-content.md`. Proposed status. Captures the DI seam design, RecordList as the first parametric primitive, reuse of existing `ViewConfig`, and the migration shape for hand-wired widgets (deferred to incremental follow-up PRs).

### Status

- `pnpm --filter @prism/core typecheck` clean
- Full `pnpm vitest run packages/prism-core packages/prism-studio` — **3553 tests across 162 files passing** (47 new)
- Pre-existing `@prism/admin-kit/src/data-sources/daemon-data-source.ts` typecheck error is in an untracked in-progress file and unrelated

### Deferred

- Migrating the ~50 existing hand-wired `if (def.type === …)` blocks into providers (one-per-category PRs).
- `FilterBuilder` visual field for composing filter expressions without typing the string grammar.
- `Repeater` over array props (non-record content like nav items / pricing tiers).
- Wiring `createSavedViewRegistry` as a RecordList props source.
- Collapsing the ten dynamic record widgets into RecordList templates.

## Dynamic record widgets for Puck builder — Tier 1 (Complete — 2026-04-13)

The Puck layout panel offered only generic data widgets (list/table/kanban/card-grid/report) that worked over any record type. Dynamic "apps-flavoured" affordances — tasks, reminders, contacts, events, notes, goals, habits, bookmarks, timer, capture inbox — were missing. Built a full set of ten specialised widgets that all query `kernel.store.allObjects()` for records of a specific `type`, rendering the appropriate UX for each domain. Designed so Tier 2 (external provider streams) can drop in without touching widget code (see ADR-003).

### What landed

1. **New `record` category in `entities.ts`** — `{ category: "record", canParent: [], canBeRoot: true }`. Free-standing data records (tasks, reminders, contacts, events, notes, goals, habits, bookmarks, timer-sessions, captures) live at the workspace root alongside pages and folders.
2. **Ten record entity defs** — `taskDef`, `reminderDef`, `contactDef`, `eventDef`, `noteDef`, `goalDef`, `habitDef`, `bookmarkDef`, `timerSessionDef`, `captureDef`. Each declares only domain-specific fields; GraphObject top-level fields (name/description/status/date/tags/pinned/color) come from the inspector's Shell section automatically.
3. **Ten widget entity defs** (`component` category, `childOnly: true`) — `tasksWidgetDef`, `remindersWidgetDef`, `contactsWidgetDef`, `eventsWidgetDef`, `notesWidgetDef`, `goalsWidgetDef`, `habitTrackerWidgetDef`, `bookmarksWidgetDef`, `timerWidgetDef`, `captureInboxWidgetDef`. Each exposes widget-level config (filter, title, maxItems, etc.) but not per-row data — the row data is pulled live from the kernel by the renderer.
4. **`dynamic-widget-renderers.tsx`** — single file housing all ten React renderers and their pure helpers. Shared `DateChip`, `cardBase`, `headingRow` styles; per-widget filter logic that short-circuits on empty inputs. Tasks widget has inline done-toggle that writes `status` back via `onToggleDone`. Reminders widget uses circular round checkbox. Contacts widget supports cards-or-list display with avatar fallback via `contactInitials()` + mailto:/tel: action chips. Events widget buckets by range (today/week/month/all) and renders relative-date chip + hh:mm time. Notes widget reads `data.body` first, description second, collapses whitespace, truncates with ellipsis. Goals widget shows `currentValue / targetValue + unit` and a progress bar via `goalRatio()`. Habit tracker uses `habitWeeklyRatio()` against `targetPerWeek`, shows streak with fire emoji. Bookmarks widget supports grid-of-favicons or list display, uses `bookmarkHost()` to parse clean hostnames. Timer widget is a local `useState` focus-timer that logs a `timer-session` via `onCreateSession`. Capture inbox widget has an inline text input that creates a `capture` via `onCaptureSubmit`, and a "Done" button per row that marks `processedAt` via `onMarkProcessed`.
5. **Pure helpers (exported for vitest)** — `parseObjectDate`, `formatRelativeDate`, `filterTasks`, `orderTasks`, `priorityColor`, `filterReminders`, `filterContacts`, `contactInitials`, `filterEvents`, `formatEventTime`, `filterNotes`, `notePreview`, `filterGoals`, `goalRatio`, `formatDuration`, `filterBookmarks`, `bookmarkHost`, `habitWeeklyRatio`, `filterCaptures`. All deterministic — `nowMs()` is injected as a parameter with `Date.now()` as default so tests can freeze time.
6. **`layout-panel.tsx` wiring** — ten new `if (def.type === "…-widget")` branches right after the `map-widget` case. Each branch (a) declares typed fields via the same `as unknown as Fields[string]` cast pattern the other widgets use, (b) filters kernel objects by the right record type, (c) forwards `selectedId` + `onSelectObject` + (for interactive widgets) `onToggleDone` / `onCreateSession` / `onCaptureSubmit` / `onMarkProcessed` callbacks that call `kernel.updateObject` / `kernel.createObject`. Capture inbox's mark-processed handler reads the existing `data` object and spreads it before writing to preserve other fields.
7. **`dynamicDataInitializer`** (`builtin-initializers.ts`) — guarded on empty store for those record types, seeds ~25 sample records (5 tasks with mixed priorities + due dates, 3 reminders, 3 contacts (2 pinned), 4 events spread across the week, 3 notes (1 pinned, all tagged), 3 goals with progress, 3 habits with streaks, 4 bookmarks, 2 captures) so first-run users see the widgets populated. Added to the `createBuiltinInitializers()` list after `demoWorkspaceInitializer`.
8. **Tests** — `dynamic-widget-renderers.test.ts` covers 59 assertions across 19 describe blocks, all pure-helper coverage: date parsing (valid/invalid/empty), relative labelling (overdue/today/tomorrow/in-Nd/far-future), task filtering (all/open/done/today/overdue + project cross-filter), task ordering (date asc with nulls last, priority tie-break), reminder filtering, contact filtering + initials, event range windowing (today/week/month/all), note filtering + preview truncation/whitespace collapse, goal ratio clamping, duration formatting (seconds/minutes/h:m), bookmark folder filtering + hostname extraction, habit weekly ratio, capture processed/pending partitioning.
9. **ADR-003** — `docs/adr/003-dynamic-data-providers.md` scopes Tier 2 (external streams). Defines a `ProviderDefinition` contract in `@prism/core/providers`, provider records tagged with `data.source: { providerId, accountId, externalId, syncedAt }`, a daemon-owned sync worker materialising into the same Loro collection, credentials via existing VFS+vault+daemon stack, and `provider-binding` entity for wiring a collection to a provider. Widgets stay dumb — they query by type and never see provenance. Priority order: Google Calendar → Gmail → filesystem inbox → RSS → Weather → iCal → GitHub → Linear. Write-back, push notifications, and Apple Calendar/Reminders/Contacts are explicit non-goals for Phase 1.

### Status

- `pnpm typecheck` clean across the monorepo
- `pnpm test` — **198 files / 3869 tests passing** (59 new tests)
- `dynamicDataInitializer` guarded on empty store so re-running won't duplicate records

### Files touched

- `packages/prism-studio/src/kernel/entities.ts` — new `record` category rule, 20 new entity defs (10 records + 10 widgets), all wired into `createPageBuilderRegistry()`
- `packages/prism-studio/src/components/dynamic-widget-renderers.tsx` (new)
- `packages/prism-studio/src/components/dynamic-widget-renderers.test.ts` (new)
- `packages/prism-studio/src/panels/layout-panel.tsx` — 10 new widget branches + imports
- `packages/prism-studio/src/kernel/builtin-initializers.ts` — new `dynamicDataInitializer`
- `docs/adr/003-dynamic-data-providers.md` (new)
- `docs/adr/README.md` — ADR-003 index entry
- `packages/prism-studio/CLAUDE.md` — documents the new renderer file

## Real Button & Card renderers for Puck builder (Complete — 2026-04-13)

The Puck layout panel was rendering `button` and `card` blocks as generic dashed-border preview chips (the `entityToPuckComponent` fallback at `layout-panel.tsx:312`), so authors couldn't tell what a button would actually look like on their page. Promoted both to real interactive previews with an extended field vocabulary aimed at developers.

### What landed

1. **`button-renderer.tsx`** — real `<button>` / `<a>` preview. Variants: primary/secondary/outline/ghost/danger/success/gradient. Sizes: xs/sm/md/lg/xl. Leading or trailing icon (any glyph/emoji). Full-width, disabled, loading (with spinner via `prism-button-spin` keyframes). Rounded preset (none→full), shadow preset, hover effect (lift/glow/scale). Link target + auto-filled `noopener noreferrer` on `_blank`. Button `type` (button/submit/reset), aria label. Pure helpers `resolveVariant`/`resolveSize`/`resolveRadius`/`resolveShadow`/`resolveTransform`/`buildButtonStyles`/`resolveRel` exported for test.
2. **`card-renderer.tsx`** — real card preview. Variants: elevated/outlined/filled/ghost. Layouts: vertical, horizontal (40% media basis), overlay (gradient wash over full-bleed media). Eyebrow, title, body, optional CTA that reuses `ButtonRenderer`. Media fit (cover/contain), aspect ratio, clamped overlay opacity, hover effect (lift/glow). Pure helpers `resolveCardVariant`/`resolveCardLayout`/`clampOverlayOpacity`/`buildCardStyles` exported.
3. **`entities.ts`** — `buttonDef` extended with icon/iconPosition/fullWidth/disabled/loading/rounded/shadow/hoverEffect/target/rel/buttonType/ariaLabel plus three new variants and two new sizes. `cardDef` extended with eyebrow/mediaFit/mediaAspectRatio/variant/layout/hoverEffect/overlayOpacity/ctaLabel/ctaVariant. Fields are grouped via `ui.group` so the inspector stays organised.
4. **`layout-panel.tsx`** — new `def.type === "button"` and `def.type === "card"` branches right after the `image` case. Each reuses `entityToPuckComponent` for automatic field generation, then replaces the `render` with the real renderer. Card's `imageUrl` field is swapped for the VFS-aware `mediaUploadField`. The generic `mediaFieldOverrides` map loses its old `card` entry (dedicated branch owns it now).
5. **Tests** — `button-renderer.test.ts` (23 assertions across 7 helper groups — variant palettes, size scaling, radius map, shadow layering, hover transform, disabled override, rel defaulting) and `card-renderer.test.ts` (17 assertions — variant defaults, layout direction, overlay opacity clamping, hover transform, elevated base shadow).

### Status

- `pnpm typecheck` clean across the monorepo
- `pnpm exec vitest run --exclude 'e2e/**'` in prism-studio — **31 files / 405 tests passing** (40 new tests)
- Pre-existing playwright-vs-vitest config collision leaves e2e specs failing under vitest; unrelated to this change

### Files touched

- `packages/prism-studio/src/components/button-renderer.tsx` (new)
- `packages/prism-studio/src/components/button-renderer.test.ts` (new)
- `packages/prism-studio/src/components/card-renderer.tsx` (new)

## Resizable 4-bar PageShell (Complete — 2026-04-13)

Layout panel's page shell was rigid: one of three hard-coded grids (`sidebar-left`/`sidebar-right`/`stacked`), single `sidebarWidth` int field, no drag handles. Replaced with a 3×3 grid of four independently-resizable bars wrapping a central main canvas.

### What landed

1. **`PageShellRenderer` rewrite** (`packages/prism-studio/src/components/layout-shell-renderers.tsx`) — 3×3 CSS Grid driven by `topBarHeight` / `leftBarWidth` / `rightBarWidth` / `bottomBarHeight`. Each populated bar renders a `<ResizeHandle>` on its inner edge (`col-resize` / `row-resize` cursor, `pointerdown`→`pointermove`→`pointerup` with `pointercancel` fallback). Drag updates local state live for smooth feedback; `onCommit(key, value)` fires once on pointerup for kernel persistence. Empty bars collapse to 0 via `hasContent(node)`. Pure `computeShellGrid()` helper exported for test.
2. **`SideBarRenderer` resizable** — standalone `SideBar` widget reuses the same `useResizeHandle` hook and now supports four positions (`left`/`right`/`top`/`bottom`) with per-position handle placement and cursor.
3. **Slot rename** (`packages/prism-studio/src/panels/layout-panel-data.ts`) — `PAGE_SLOTS = ["topBar", "leftBar", "rightBar", "bottomBar"]`; `SHELL_SLOTS["page-shell"] = ["topBar", "leftBar", "main", "rightBar", "bottomBar"]`. Per CLAUDE.md "rename, move, break, fix" — no back-compat for `header`/`sidebar`/`footer` slot names.
4. **Entity defs** (`packages/prism-studio/src/kernel/entities.ts`) — `pageDef` and `pageShellDef` replaced old `layout`/`sidebarWidth`/`stickyHeader` fields with `topBarHeight`/`leftBarWidth`/`rightBarWidth`/`bottomBarHeight`/`stickyTopBar`. Page `layout` enum simplified to `flow` | `shell`.
5. **`rootRender` wiring** (`layout-panel.tsx`) — in `shell` mode, passes the four slot functions + dimension props into `PageShellRenderer` and supplies an `onCommit` closure that calls `kernel.updateObject(pageId, { data: { ...currentData, [key]: value } })` on pointerup. `flow` mode unchanged (free-scrolling single column).
6. **Seeds** — `playground-seed.ts` shell page now seeds `topBar`/`leftBar`/`rightBar`/`bottomBar` content with non-zero dimensions so every bar renders on first load. `builtin-initializers.ts` About page switched from `layout: "sidebar"` to `layout: "shell"`.
7. **Test updates**
   - `layout-panel.test.ts` — `seedShellPage` + `kernelToPuckData` projection test + `walkTree` round-trip + `splitRootProps` + new `computeShellGrid` suite (4 cases: full grid, absent bars collapsing, clamp negative/huge, fractional rounding).
   - `loro-puck-bridge.test.ts` — slot-shaped round-trip data updated to the new PageShell shape.

### Status

- `pnpm typecheck` clean across `@prism/core`, `@prism/studio`, `@prism/puck-playground`
- `pnpm lint` clean
- `pnpm test` — **196 files / 3793 tests passing**

### Files touched

## Universal Admin Kit — Puck-native admin panels for every runtime (Complete — 2026-04-13)

Daemon, Relay, and Studio each had their own ad-hoc "admin" views. Unified them behind a single Puck-native package (`@prism/admin-kit`) so one editable dashboard can reflect any Prism runtime — in-process kernel, or remote HTTP relay — through a normalised `AdminSnapshot`.

### What landed

1. **New package `@prism/admin-kit`** — Puck widget library + data source abstraction.
   - `types.ts`: `AdminDataSource` interface, `AdminSnapshot`/`HealthStatus`/`Metric`/`Service`/`ActivityItem`/`HealthLevel`, `emptySnapshot()` initial value.
   - `admin-helpers.ts`: pure `formatUptime`/`formatBytes`/`formatMetricValue`/`formatRelativeTime`/`rollupHealth` + `HEALTH_COLORS` palette.
   - `admin-context.tsx`: `AdminProvider` — wires a data source to a reactive snapshot via subscribe-path (if supported) or `setInterval` fallback. Exposes `useAdminContext()` + `useAdminSnapshot()`.
   - `widgets/`: `SourceHeader`, `HealthBadge`, `MetricCard`, `MetricChart` (Recharts line/bar), `ServiceList`, `ActivityTail`, `UptimeCard` — each consumes `useAdminSnapshot()` and renders framework-free dark-theme CSS.
   - `puck-config.tsx`: `createAdminPuckConfig()` registers every widget with `fields`/`defaultProps`/`render`, categorised into `summary`/`metrics`/`lists`. Mirrors layout-panel's `as unknown as Fields[string]` casting pattern.
   - `default-layout.ts`: `createDefaultAdminLayout()` seeds a drag-ready dashboard (header + health + uptime + 5 metric cards + trend chart + service list + activity tail).
   - Package exports: `.`, `./widgets`, `./data-sources`, `./puck`.

2. **Two canonical data sources.**
   - **`createKernelDataSource(kernel, opts)`** — projects a StudioKernel-shaped target (`store`/`notifications`/`relay`/`presence`/`bus`/optional `listFiles`) into an `AdminSnapshot`. Uses a structural `KernelAdminTarget` interface to avoid a studio→admin-kit cycle. `subscribe()` lazily attaches `PrismBus` listeners (`ObjectCreated`/`Updated`/`Deleted`/`EdgeCreated`/`EdgeDeleted`) + `NotificationStore.subscribe` + `RelayManager.subscribe`, pushing fresh snapshots; detaches on last listener leave. Ring-buffer activity feed (default 50), seeded from `NotificationStore.getAll()`.
   - **`createRelayDataSource({url, fetch?, now?})`** — HTTP client for a running `@prism/relay` server. Parallel fetches `/api/health` + `/api/modules` + `/metrics`. Unreachable → `error` health + diagnostic detail; reachable → module list mapped to services, numeric metrics rolled up. Prometheus samples back-fill uptime/peers/connections when the JSON health endpoint omits them. Injectable `fetch` / `now` for tests.

3. **Prometheus parser on top of `@prism/core/syntax`'s Scanner.**
   - Per user directive: "any parsing should be done via Prism Syntax / Codegen". Rewrote `data-sources/prometheus-parse.ts` to use `Scanner`/`ScanError`/`isDigit`/`isIdentChar`/`isIdentStart`.
   - Custom `isPromNameStart`/`isPromNameChar` predicates allow `:` in metric names. `scanSample` handles unlabelled + labelled samples, `scanLabels` state-machine handles `{k="v",...}` with quoted values, `scanNumberLiteral` special-cases Prometheus `+Inf`/`-Inf`/`NaN` tokens then delegates to `Scanner.scanNumber`. Line-level error recovery: a malformed line swallows its `ScanError` and continues at the next newline.
   - `findSample(samples, name, filter?)` — helper for name + optional label filtering.

4. **Studio integration — `adminLensBundle`.**
   - New `panels/admin-panel.tsx`: `AdminPanel` component with a source picker dropdown (Kernel + each configured relay), `<AdminProvider>` wrapping `<Puck config={createAdminPuckConfig()} data={…} onChange={setData} />`. Data source is memoized per source id; cleanup via `dispose?.()` in effect cleanup; auto-reverts to Kernel when the selected relay disappears.
   - Lens registered as `ADMIN_LENS_ID` with `Shift+A` keybinding, wired into `createBuiltinLensBundles()`.
   - `@prism/admin-kit` added to `prism-studio/package.json` dependencies; tsconfig path alias + root `tsconfig.base.json` path alias + Vite regex aliases added for both `@prism/admin-kit` and `@prism/admin-kit/*`.

### Test coverage

- `packages/prism-admin-kit/src/admin-helpers.test.ts` (21 tests) — every formatter + `rollupHealth` + `HEALTH_COLORS`.
- `packages/prism-admin-kit/src/data-sources/prometheus-parse.test.ts` (12 tests) — empty input, comments, unlabelled + labelled samples, colon metric names, signed/fractional values, `Inf`/`NaN`, malformed-line recovery, `findSample` name + label filtering.
- `packages/prism-admin-kit/src/data-sources/relay-data-source.test.ts` (6 tests) — default + custom id/label, full snapshot composition, unreachable fallback, Prometheus back-fill, thrown-fetch graceful handling.
- `packages/prism-admin-kit/src/data-sources/kernel-data-source.test.ts` (8 tests) — projection, service health inference, unread notification warn, bus-event activity capture, subscription cleanup, injected clock.
- `packages/prism-admin-kit/src/puck-config.test.ts` (6 tests) — component registration, category grouping, defaultProps/render presence, default-layout shape + unique ids, only references registered components.
- `packages/prism-studio/src/panels/admin-panel.test.ts` (5 tests) — lens manifest shape, bundle install into LensRegistry, real StudioKernel projection, streaming snapshots on mutation.

### Status

- `pnpm typecheck` — clean across all 7 packages (added admin-kit alongside existing 6)
- `pnpm test` — **195 files / 3766 tests passing** (was 3708; +58 new)
- `pnpm build` — Studio production bundle succeeds (includes admin-kit via Vite aliases)

### Files touched

- **New:**
  - `packages/prism-admin-kit/package.json`, `tsconfig.json`
  - `packages/prism-admin-kit/src/index.ts`, `types.ts`, `admin-helpers.ts`, `admin-helpers.test.ts`, `admin-context.tsx`, `puck-config.tsx`, `puck-config.test.ts`, `default-layout.ts`

  - `packages/prism-studio/src/panels/admin-panel.tsx`, `admin-panel.test.ts`
- **Modified:**
  - `packages/prism-studio/package.json` — add `@prism/admin-kit: workspace:*`
  - `packages/prism-studio/tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts` — path + Vite aliases

## Puck builder — fonts, universal styling, page-native slots (Complete — 2026-04-13)

Three gaps closed on the Layout Panel: font family was a free-form string, most widgets couldn't access the style-field spread (align/color/size/font), and sidebar/header/footer layout required dropping a `PageShell` block explicitly. Pages are now layout-aware as a first-class concept — no implicit wrapper.

### What landed

1. **Font picker with Google Fonts preview** — `@prism/core/page-builder` now re-exports a new `fonts.ts` module (`FONT_OPTIONS`, `findFontOption`, `isGoogleFontValue`, `googleFontsHref`, `collectFontFamilies`) covering 3 system stacks + 15 Google families with declared weights.
   - `components/puck-custom-fields.tsx` adds `fontPickerField({ label? })`: a native grouped `<select>` where each `<option>` renders in its own font face, plus a dashed preview swatch below. At construction time it injects `<link rel="stylesheet">` tags into `document.head` for every Google family (idempotent via a module-level `loadedFontHrefs` set, guarded by `typeof document`).
   - `layout-panel.tsx` `entityToPuckComponent()` routes any field with `id === "fontFamily"` to `fontPickerField`, so every text-bearing entity inherits the picker automatically.
   - HTML export (`@prism/core/page-builder → page-export.ts`) walks the exported node tree with `collectFontFamilies()` and emits `<link rel="preconnect">` + `<link rel="stylesheet">` for every Google family used, wired in the `<head>` next to `<title>`.

2. **Universal style fields on every Puck widget** — `layout-panel.tsx` adds `attachStyleFieldsInPlace(components)`, a single post-processing pass that merges `STYLE_FIELD_DEFS` into every component config that doesn't already expose `fontFamily` (i.e. every hand-rolled widget — kanban/list/table/chart/map/stat/badge/alert/progress/markdown/iframe/code/video/audio/tabs/popover/slide/form inputs/layout primitives).
   - Each wrapped render funnel the original output through a `<div style={computeBlockStyle(extractBlockStyle(props))} className={props.className}>`. No-op when no style props are set (falls back to a fragment).
   - Idempotent because entity-def-flow components (heading, text-block, shells, card, etc.) already include `fontFamily` via their `...STYLE_FIELD_DEFS` spread and are skipped.
   - Cached style-field schema in `STYLE_PUCK_FIELDS_CACHE` so the Puck field construction doesn't rebuild per-component.

3. **Page-native slots — no implicit PageShell** — the `page` entity now owns `layout`/`sidebarWidth`/`stickyHeader` directly and projects its `__slot`-tagged children into Puck's `root.props` via `PAGE_SLOTS = ["header", "sidebar", "footer"]`.
   - `panels/layout-panel-data.ts`: `SHELL_SLOTS["page"] = PAGE_SLOTS`; `kernelToPuckData()` now copies non-`__slot` keys from `page.data` into `root.props` and fills each `PAGE_SLOTS` key with `buildPuckContent(pageId, slot, ...)`. `splitRootProps()` is the reverse partition used by `syncPuckToKernel`.
   - `panels/layout-panel.tsx`: the Puck `root` config is built from `entityToPuckComponent(pageDef)` fields + `{type: "slot"}` fields for each `PAGE_SLOTS` entry. The root render reads `layout` off `root.props` and wraps the main flow in `PageShellRenderer` for `sidebar-left`/`sidebar-right`/`stacked`, falls through to the original flow container for `flow` (default).
   - `kernel/entities.ts`: `pageDef.layout` enum is now `flow|stacked|sidebar-left|sidebar-right` (was `single|sidebar|full`), default `"flow"`; added `sidebarWidth` (int, default 240) and `stickyHeader` (bool, default true).
   - `syncPuckToKernel` rewrites root handling: splits `rootProps` via `splitRootProps`, updates the page entity's `data` with the scalar keys (preserving any existing `__slot` tag), then diffs each slot's content array against existing `__slot`-tagged children. Added `kernel.store.getObject` to the `KernelSync` type.
   - `@prism/puck-playground/playground-seed.ts`: `buildShellPage()` drops header/sidebar/footer children directly on the page with `__slot` tags (no `PageShell` wrapper); `pageRoot()` accepts an `extraData` bag for `{layout, sidebarWidth, stickyHeader}`.

### Test coverage

- `packages/prism-core/src/interaction/page-builder/fonts.test.ts` (new, 15 tests) — `FONT_OPTIONS` structure, `findFontOption` (exact stack / leading family / unknown / empty), `isGoogleFontValue`, `googleFontsHref` (empty / single / multi-dedup / `+` encoding for "Playfair Display"), `collectFontFamilies` (nested walk + dedup, ignores empty).
- `packages/prism-studio/src/panels/layout-panel.test.ts` — added a `kernelToPuckData — page-level slot projection` describe block and a `splitRootProps` describe block covering scalar/slot partition, default empty arrays for missing slots, non-array coercion, and undefined input handling.

### Status

- `pnpm typecheck` — clean across all 6 packages
- `pnpm test` — **189 files / 3708 tests passing** (was 3688)
- No explicit `PageShell` block is needed to get a sidebar; the palette still offers `PageShell` for nested shells (site-header, hero, etc.)

### Files touched
- **New:** `packages/prism-core/src/interaction/page-builder/fonts.ts`, `fonts.test.ts`
- **Modified:** `packages/prism-core/src/interaction/page-builder/index.ts`, `page-export.ts`; `packages/prism-studio/src/components/puck-custom-fields.tsx`; `packages/prism-studio/src/kernel/entities.ts`; `packages/prism-studio/src/panels/layout-panel.tsx`, `layout-panel-data.ts`, `layout-panel.test.ts`; `packages/prism-puck-playground/src/playground-seed.ts`

## Puck builder — functional design pass (Complete — 2026-04-13)

Functional design pass on the Layout Panel (`@prism/studio` → `panels/layout-panel.tsx`) to make the Puck visual builder productive end-to-end instead of just "technically wired up". Four concrete gaps closed: facets couldn't be created from inside the builder, media had no upload path, component palette was one flat list, and there was no at-a-glance context about which page you were editing.

### What landed

1. **VFS media URL scheme + resolver** — new `components/vfs-media-url.ts` bridges the pre-existing `vfs://<hash>` convention (written by `assets-panel.tsx` but never read) to DOM-consumable blob URLs.
   - Exports `VFS_SCHEME`, `isVfsMediaUrl`, `parseVfsHash`, `buildVfsMediaUrl`, `isBrowserMediaUrl`, `resolveVfsMediaUrl`, `useResolvedMediaUrl`.
   - Module-scoped `blobUrlCache: Map<hash, blobUrl>` — content-addressed hashes are immutable so the cache entry is safe forever. `__resetVfsMediaCache` exported for tests.
   - `useResolvedMediaUrl` hook initializes synchronously for http/https/data/blob (no flash), only awaits for `vfs://`.
   - Test file `vfs-media-url.test.ts` exercises the pure helpers + the async resolver against a real `createVfsManager` (stat cache hit on 2nd call verified).

2. **`mediaUploadField` — VFS-integrated Puck custom field** — new `components/vfs-media-field.tsx`.
   - Factory `mediaUploadField(kernel, { label?, accept? })` returns a Puck `Field<string>` that closes over the kernel. Render delegates to `<MediaUploadFieldInner>` where hooks are legal (Puck invokes render as a React component).
   - Three input modes: **upload** (drag-drop or file picker → `kernel.importFile` → `vfs://<hash>`), **pick from vault** (filtered by MIME prefix via `kernel.listFiles` — same BinaryRef index the Assets panel uses), **paste URL** (http/https fallback for external assets).
   - Success/failure feedback via `kernel.notifications.add()` — same toast queue every Studio action uses.
   - `accept: "image" | "video" | "audio" | ""` drives both the filter and the native `<input accept="image/*">` attribute.
   - Preview box resolves `vfs://` hashes via `useResolvedMediaUrl`, shows filename/MIME/size from `BinaryRef` for vault files.

3. **`facetPickerField` — inline facet creator Puck custom field** — new `components/facet-picker-field.tsx`.
   - Dropdown of `kernel.listFacetDefinitions()` + **New…** button that reveals an inline form capturing name / objectType / layout.
   - Object-type suggestions come from `kernel.registry.allDefs()` filtered to non-workspace/non-section — authors can't target types that don't exist.
   - Creates via `createFacetDefinition(id, objectType, layout)` from `@prism/core/facet`; collisions resolved by `uniqueFacetId`; success emits a notification.
   - Pure helpers `facetIdFromName(name, objectType)` and `uniqueFacetId(base, existing)` split into `components/facet-picker-helpers.ts` so vitest can exercise them in the node env without loading Puck.

4. **Media renderers accept `vfs://` URLs** — `components/media-renderers.tsx` (`VideoWidgetRenderer`, `AudioWidgetRenderer`).
   - `isSafeMediaUrl` allow-list extended: accepts `http://`, `https://`, and `vfs://<hash>`.
   - Both renderers call `useResolvedMediaUrl(src, kernel.vfs)` and emit loading / missing placeholder states.
   - Poster images on the video widget also resolve through the same pipeline.
   - `media-renderers.test.ts` now covers the vfs case.

5. **Image block** — `PuckImageBlockRender` React component added to `layout-panel.tsx`. Uses `useResolvedMediaUrl` so `vfs://` hashes produce real `<img>` tags with width/height/alt/caption. The image entity bypasses the generic Puck component factory (`continue` after building its ComponentConfig) so it can opt into the dedicated renderer + `mediaUploadField` for `src`.

6. **Component categories** — layout panel now passes `config.categories` to Puck instead of dumping every entity into one sidebar list.
   - `COMPONENT_CATEGORY_MAP`, `CATEGORY_TITLES`, `buildPuckCategories()`, and `PuckCategoryBucket` moved into `panels/layout-panel-data.ts` so they're importable from vitest without loading the full UI graph (leaflet, recharts, Puck runtime).
   - Eight buckets: Layout, Content, Media, Data Views, Forms, Navigation, Display, Dynamic; plus Puck's built-in `other` catch-all for unmapped types. Layout + Content are `defaultExpanded`.
   - Insertion order is driven by `CATEGORY_TITLES`, so sidebar ordering is stable regardless of `Object.keys(components)` order upstream. Empty non-`other` buckets are pruned via a rebuild (not `delete`, to satisfy `no-dynamic-delete` lint).
   - New video/audio/image/card/hero blocks wire in `mediaUploadField` via a `mediaFieldOverrides` map (card.imageUrl, hero.backgroundImage) on the generic path.

7. **Facet picker wired into facet-view + spatial-canvas blocks** — `facetId` fields on those blocks use `facetPickerField(kernel, { label: "Facet" })` so an author can create the bound FacetDefinition without leaving the layout builder.

8. **Header strip above the Puck canvas** — wraps `<Puck>` in a flex column with a top row that shows the current page title (falls back to `page.name`), slug, and a published/draft badge. Test IDs: `layout-panel`, `layout-panel-header`, `layout-panel-page-title`, `layout-panel-status-badge`.

### Test coverage

`packages/prism-studio/src/panels/layout-panel.test.ts` (14 tests total):
- **Existing shell projection tests** — unchanged (2 tests covering `kernelToPuckData` + Puck `walkTree` round-trip).
- **`buildPuckCategories` (5 tests)** — drops empty non-other buckets, sends unknown types to `other`, marks layout+content as `defaultExpanded`, preserves canonical insertion order, and verifies **every** `component`/`section` entity registered by `createStudioKernel()` lands in an expected bucket (nothing silently goes missing).
- **`pascalToKebab` / `kebabToPascal`** — round-trip for every key in `COMPONENT_CATEGORY_MAP`.
- **`facetIdFromName` (3 tests)** — slugifies human names, collapses runs of non-alphanumerics, falls back to `<objectType>-facet` on empty input.
- **`uniqueFacetId` (3 tests)** — returns base id when no collision, suffixes `-2` on first collision, walks past contiguous collisions.

`packages/prism-studio/src/components/vfs-media-url.test.ts` — new file, covers the URL-scheme helpers and the async resolver (including the content-addressed cache hit).

`packages/prism-studio/src/components/media-renderers.test.ts` — extended with a `vfs://` case on `isSafeMediaUrl`.

### Status

- `pnpm typecheck` — clean across all 6 packages
- `pnpm test` — 188 files / 3688 tests passing (was 3006 tests at the start of the pass)
- `pnpm lint` — clean

### Files touched
- **New:** `packages/prism-studio/src/components/vfs-media-url.ts`, `vfs-media-url.test.ts`, `vfs-media-field.tsx`, `facet-picker-field.tsx`, `facet-picker-helpers.ts`
- **Modified:** `packages/prism-studio/src/panels/layout-panel.tsx`, `layout-panel-data.ts`, `layout-panel.test.ts`; `components/media-renderers.tsx`, `media-renderers.test.ts`

## Puck builders — real chart/map renderers + standalone playground harness (Complete — 2026-04-12)

Replaced the placeholder chart and map widget renderers in `@prism/studio` with real `recharts` + `react-leaflet` implementations and stood up a new `@prism/puck-playground` package — a single-file Vite SPA that boots a real `StudioKernel` with seeded demo data so the layout panel and every data-aware Puck widget can be exercised in isolation, away from the full Studio shell.

### What landed

1. **`@prism/studio` widget renderers — real implementations**
   - **`components/chart-widget-renderer.tsx`** rewritten to use **recharts ^2.15.0** (`<ResponsiveContainer>` wrapping `BarChart`/`LineChart`/`PieChart`/`AreaChart`). Dark theme: `#0f172a` background, `#a855f7` accent, `#94a3b8` axes. Pie uses `<Cell>` per slice with `CHART_PALETTE`; bar/line/area share `CartesianGrid`/`XAxis`/`YAxis`/`Tooltip`.
   - **`components/map-widget-renderer.tsx`** rewritten to use **react-leaflet ^5.0.0 + leaflet ^1.9.4** with `MapContainer`/`TileLayer` (OSM)/`Marker`/`Popup`. Patches Leaflet's default icon URLs by importing `leaflet/dist/images/marker-icon{,-2x,-shadow}.png`. A custom inline `FitBounds` component uses `useMap()` to refit on bounds change. Click handlers use a conditional spread (`{...(onSelectObject ? { eventHandlers: ... } : {})}`) so `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` doesn't reject `undefined` for `LeafletEventHandlerFnMap`.
2. **Pure-logic split for vitest compatibility** — both renderers had to keep working under vitest's node env where recharts/leaflet can't evaluate. New sibling files isolate the pure helpers:
   - **`components/chart-data.ts`** — `aggregateObjects`, `CHART_PALETTE`, types `ChartType`/`ChartAggregation`/`ChartDataPoint`. The renderer re-exports it for back-compat.
   - **`components/map-data.ts`** — `extractMarkers`, `computeBounds`, types `MapMarker`/`MapBounds`.
   - Test files updated to import from `./chart-data.js` and `./map-data.js` instead of the renderers. Neither renderer imports `leaflet/dist/leaflet.css` — host apps do that from their own `main.tsx` so vitest stays DOM-free.
3. **`src/vite-env.d.ts` (new)** — `*.png`/`*.svg`/`*.css` ambient module declarations so the leaflet PNG imports type-check under TS strict.
4. **`@prism/studio` deps** — added `leaflet ^1.9.4`, `react-leaflet ^5.0.0`, `recharts ^2.15.0`, devDep `@types/leaflet ^1.9.12`. `main.tsx` gains `import "leaflet/dist/leaflet.css"`.
5. **New package: `@prism/puck-playground`** — standalone Vite SPA that bundles to a single self-contained `dist/index.html` (~10 MB, ~3 MB gzipped) via [`vite-plugin-singlefile`](https://github.com/richardtallent/vite-plugin-singlefile). Contents:
   - **`vite.config.ts`** — reuses `buildCoreAliases()` (one alias per `@prism/core/*` subpath, sorted longest-first) plus a regex alias `@prism/studio/*` → `../prism-studio/src/$1`. Mirrored in `tsconfig.json` `paths`. The playground always sees latest studio source — no build step, no `exports` field, no publish.
   - **`src/playground-seed.ts`** (562 lines) — a custom `StudioInitializer` that seeds five sample collections (15 `demo-task`, 8 `demo-contact`, 16 `demo-sale`, 7 `demo-place` with real lat/lng for Anthropic HQ / Berlin / Tokyo / etc., 8 `demo-event` with dates relative to today) and seven demo pages, each calling a `build*Page()` function that pre-populates the page with curated Puck blocks: Welcome (hero + stats), Data Widgets (kanban/list/table/card-grid), Charts & Reports (bar/line/pie/area + report widget), Map & Calendar, Forms (text/email/textarea/select/number/date/checkbox), Display & Content (alert/badge/progress-bar/markdown/code-block), Layout Primitives (columns/divider/spacer/tab-container). Guarded by `kernel.store.objectCount() > 0` so it's idempotent. Ends with `kernel.undo.clear()` and `kernel.select(welcome.id)`.
   - **`src/playground-app.tsx`** — `createStudioKernel({ lensBundles: [layoutLensBundle], initializers: [playgroundSeedInitializer] })`, `KernelProvider` wrapping `LayoutPanel`, left sidebar listing every `page` object with active-page tracking via `parentId` walk, header with **Reset workspace** button that disposes the kernel and re-mounts via `key` swap.
   - **`src/main.tsx`** — React root mount, imports `leaflet/dist/leaflet.css` for the host app.
   - Plugins: `react()`, `wasm()`, `topLevelAwait()`, `viteSingleFile()` (the last two are mandatory because the kernel pulls in `loro-crdt`).
   - `cssCodeSplit: false`, `assetsInlineLimit: 100_000_000` so the build is truly single-file.
   - Dev server on `:4179` (strictPort).
6. **Docs** — `packages/prism-puck-playground/README.md` and `packages/prism-puck-playground/CLAUDE.md` cover the harness's purpose, build commands, source-aliasing trick, demo workspace contents, and reset behaviour. `packages/prism-studio/CLAUDE.md` updated to reflect the recharts/leaflet swap and the chart-data/map-data pure-logic split.

### Status

- `pnpm --filter @prism/puck-playground typecheck` — clean
- `pnpm --filter @prism/puck-playground build` — `dist/index.html` 10,349,992 bytes (3.0 MB gzipped), built in ~7.5 s
- `pnpm --filter @prism/puck-playground dev` — boots on `http://localhost:4179` in ~150 ms, serves transformed modules cleanly
- `pnpm --filter @prism/studio vitest run --exclude 'e2e/**'` — **327 / 327 unit tests passing** (the 31 collection failures in the unfiltered run are pre-existing Playwright-file collisions unrelated to this work)

### Notes

- The playground deliberately installs only `layoutLensBundle`, not `createBuiltinLensBundles()`. Adding another lens to repro something is a one-line import (`import { canvasLensBundle } from "@prism/studio/panels/canvas-panel.js"`).
- The demo pages can be edited inside the playground freely — those edits live in the kernel's in-memory `CollectionStore` only and disappear on **Reset workspace**, which is the entire point of the harness.
- Future work: a `pnpm --filter @prism/puck-playground preview-static` script that opens `dist/index.html` directly via `file://` to verify the single-file output works without a server. Right now this is a manual step.

## ADR 002 Phases 2–4 — Luau fold, Studio→Core extraction, Registry collapse (Complete — 2026-04-12)

Completed the remaining three phases of ADR-002, bringing the unified language/document model to its final shape and extracting shared kernel infrastructure from Studio into Core so future apps (Flux, Lattice, Musica) can reuse it.

### Phase 2 — Fold Luau into `language/luau/`

Merged the two disjoint Luau directories (`syntax/luau/` for parsing and standalone `luau/` for runtime+debugger) into a single `language/luau/` home. `createLuauContribution()` is now the canonical entry point, replacing the old `createLuauLanguageDefinition()` + ad-hoc `DocumentSurfaceRegistry` pair.

### Phase 3 — Extract Studio kernel modules to Core

Moved 5 pure support modules from `packages/prism-studio/src/kernel/` to their final `@prism/core/*` homes via `git mv`:

- `design-tokens.ts` → `@prism/core/design-tokens` (DesignTokenRegistry, tokensToCss, DEFAULT_TOKENS)
- `block-style.ts` → `@prism/core/page-builder` (BlockStyleData, STYLE_FIELD_DEFS, computeBlockStyle — de-React-ified: `CssStyle = Record<string, string | number>` replaces React `CSSProperties`)
- `page-export.ts` → `@prism/core/page-builder` (exportPageToJson, exportPageToHtml, renderNodeHtml)
- `relay-manager.ts` → `@prism/core/relay-manager` (createRelayManager, RelayEntry)
- `builder-manager.ts` → `@prism/core/builder` (merged into existing builder/, circular `@prism/core/builder` self-import fixed with relative imports)

Created `@prism/core/initializer` — generic `KernelInitializer<TKernel>` post-boot hook pattern. Studio's `StudioInitializer` is now a thin alias (`KernelInitializer<StudioKernel>`).

All Studio imports updated to consume from `@prism/core/*`. Studio kernel directory now contains only wiring + entity definitions.

### Phase 4 — Unify codegen + collapse registries

Unified `LanguageRegistry` replaces the old split between `LanguageDefinition` + `DocumentSurfaceRegistry`. `LanguageContribution` is the single registration type. Compat bridge (`compat.ts`) retired. Markdown contribution (`createMarkdownContribution()`) created so there is exactly one markdown tokenizer.

### Status

- `pnpm -r typecheck` — all 5 workspace packages clean
- `pnpm test` — **186 files, 3655 tests passing**
- ADR-002 status updated to **Accepted**
- `packages/prism-core/CLAUDE.md` and `packages/prism-studio/CLAUDE.md` updated to reflect final locations
- No `layer1`/`layer2` references remain in source code (only in historical ADR/plan docs)

## prism-daemon — Whisper + Conferencing (Tracks, Rooms, Streaming STT) (Complete — 2026-04-12)

Closed every gap between the existing data-channel/batch-STT primitives and real chatroom functionality: audio/video tracks, room management (P2P mesh + Relay SFU), and streaming Whisper sessions. The daemon can now transport pre-encoded media frames, group peers into multi-party rooms, and incrementally transcribe audio — the three building blocks the SPEC's "Self-Dictation" pattern needs.

### What landed

1. **Audio/video track support** (conferencing module, 5 new commands) — `conferencing.{add_track,write_sample,recv_track_data,list_tracks,remove_track}`. Local tracks are `TrackLocalStaticSample` backed by `RTCRtpCodecCapability` (Opus @ 48 kHz stereo for audio, VP8 @ 90 kHz for video). `write_sample` accepts hex-encoded pre-encoded media frames — the host encodes (Opus/VP8), the daemon transports. Remote tracks are received via `on_track` callback which spawns a tokio task that continuously reads RTP payloads into a `TrackInbox`. `recv_track_data` drains buffered samples as hex.
2. **Room management** (conferencing module, 6 new commands) — `conferencing.{create_room,join_room,leave_room,room_info,list_rooms,broadcast_data}`. Rooms group peer connections for multi-party calls. Full-mesh P2P for small groups (2–4), Relay SFU for larger ones. `broadcast_data` fans a data-channel message to every room member. `join_room` validates peer exists; `leave_room` is idempotent.
3. **Streaming Whisper sessions** (whisper module, 4 new commands) — `whisper.{create_session,push_audio,poll_segments,close_session}`. Sessions accumulate PCM via `push_audio`. `poll_segments` transcribes the entire buffer and returns ALL segments plus `audio_duration_ms` (whisper.cpp `full()` resets state per call — host diffs results). For the SPEC's Self-Dictation pattern the host forks raw PCM to both whisper and Opus encode → track write.
4. **Conferencing module total: 24 commands** (13 original + 5 track + 6 room). **Whisper module total: 9 commands** (5 batch + 4 streaming). Added `webrtc-media = "0.9"` dep for the `Sample` type.
5. **Tests** — `cargo test --features conferencing` is **87 lib + 9 integration + 2 stdio = 98 passing**. New: track add/list/remove, room create/join/leave/info/list, unknown peer/room/kind rejection. Whisper gains 4 streaming tests. Clippy clean, formatted.

### Status

- `cargo test --lib` (default) — **72 lib tests passing** (unchanged)
- `cargo test --features conferencing` — **87 lib + 9 integration + 2 stdio = 98 tests passing**
- `cargo clippy --features conferencing --all-targets -- -D warnings` — clean
- `cargo check --features whisper` — still requires `cmake` on PATH

### Notes / deferred

- **No Opus/VP8 encode/decode in the daemon** — tracks transport pre-encoded frames; host handles codecs.
- **Whisper ↔ conferencing bridge is host-orchestrated** — the host forks mic PCM to whisper and Opus encode pipelines. Keeps modules independent and composable.
- **Room signaling is local** — cross-daemon peer discovery goes through the Relay's signaling channel.
- Future: video-codec feature (libvpx for daemon-side VP8), Opus codec feature (for daemon-side encode/decode), SFU relay integration.

## prism-daemon — VFS + Crypto + Cross-Surface E2E (Complete — 2026-04-11)

Made the Rust `prism-daemon` crate implement every SPEC-critical primitive that can run on every target we ship (desktop, mobile, browser, embedded), and wired up end-to-end tests that exercise each surface through its real transport rather than a host simulator.

### What landed

1. **VFS module** (`src/modules/vfs_module.rs`, 13 unit tests) — content-addressed blob store behind `vfs.{put,get,has,delete,list,stats}`. SHA-256 hex keys, atomic `write-temp + rename` writes, lock-free reads. Hosts inject a `VfsManager` rooted at the app data directory via `builder.set_vfs_manager(...)`; the module lazily creates one under the OS temp dir if nothing is plugged in. This is the local implementation of the SPEC's `object_store` adapter.
2. **Crypto module** (`src/modules/crypto_module.rs`, 14 unit tests) — libsodium-equivalent primitives (X25519 ECDH + XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD + CSPRNG) behind `crypto.{keypair,derive_public,shared_secret,encrypt,decrypt,random_bytes}`. Pure-Rust RustCrypto crates (`x25519-dalek`, `chacha20poly1305`, `rand_core`) rather than `libsodium-sys` so iOS/Android/emscripten all compile without a C toolchain dep. Every byte field on the wire is lowercase hex.
3. **Builder + kernel wiring** — `DaemonBuilder` gains `set_vfs_manager/vfs_manager_slot/with_vfs/with_crypto`; `DaemonKernel` gains a `vfs_manager()` accessor; `with_defaults()` now installs vfs + crypto alongside crdt/luau/build/watcher when their features are active.
4. **Feature matrix** — `Cargo.toml` adds `vfs = ["dep:sha2", "dep:hex"]` and `crypto = ["dep:chacha20poly1305", "dep:x25519-dalek", "dep:rand_core", "dep:hex"]`. `full` and `wasm` pull them both in; `mobile` pulls them both in (E2EE + blob store are the whole point of mobile sync); `embedded` stays at crdt-only so a future no_std-leaning target remains viable.
5. **Stdio-binary E2E test** (`tests/stdio_bin.rs`, 2 tests) — spawns `prism-daemond` as a subprocess and drives crdt/luau/vfs/crypto commands through real stdin/stdout JSON. The CLI-transport analogue of the Playwright browser suite.
6. **Playwright suite extended** (`e2e/wasm.spec.ts`) — seven new tests covering vfs put/get/delete/list/stats and crypto keypair/shared_secret/encrypt/decrypt/AEAD-tamper/random_bytes through the real emscripten C ABI inside Chromium. Total: 19 tests × 2 profiles (dev/prod) = 38 browser runs.
7. **Kernel integration tests extended** (`tests/kernel_integration.rs`) — `with_defaults_installs_every_feature_module` now covers vfs/crypto command registration; `installed_modules_reports_install_order` rewritten to walk only the shortcuts compiled into the current feature set, so mobile/embedded/wasm runs exercise the real builder path; added `vfs_blob_store_roundtrips_through_kernel_invoke` and `crypto_keypair_ecdh_and_aead_flow_through_kernel` for end-to-end coverage through `kernel.invoke()`.
8. **Full-matrix runner** (`scripts/test-all.sh`) — orchestrates host cargo tests for all four feature combos, clippy under each combo, `cargo fmt --check`, WASM dev+prod cross-compile, Playwright dev+prod, iOS xcframework build + C ABI symbol check (`_prism_daemon_{create,destroy,invoke,free_string}`), Android per-ABI cdylib build + matching symbol check. `--skip-mobile/--skip-e2e/--skip-wasm` let you trim the run when iterating.
9. **Docs refreshed** — `packages/prism-daemon/CLAUDE.md` now lists the new modules, the expanded feature matrix, the full test inventory, the matrix runner, and the mobile FFI sanity check procedure.

### Status

- `cargo test` (default) — **60 lib + 9 integration + 2 stdio_bin = 71 tests passing**
- `cargo test --no-default-features --features mobile` — **50 lib + 9 integration = 59 passing**
- `cargo test --no-default-features --features embedded` — **11 lib + 7 integration = 18 passing**
- `cargo test --no-default-features --features wasm --lib` — **50 tests passing**
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` — clean across every feature combo
- `cargo fmt --check` — clean
- `scripts/build-wasm.sh {dev,prod}` — prod build is 3.4 MB wasm + 67 KB JS glue
- `scripts/build-ios.sh` — xcframework assembled, device slice nm-verified for the C ABI
- `scripts/build-android.sh debug` — libprism_daemon.so + libc++_shared.so staged into jniLibs for arm64-v8a / armeabi-v7a / x86_64, all nm-verified
- Playwright — **19 dev + 19 prod = 38 passing**, exercising every command (crdt/luau/vfs/crypto) through the real emscripten C ABI inside Chromium
- Mobile scripts each build under `--features mobile` and ship the `prism_daemon_{create,destroy,invoke,free_string}` C ABI symbols.

### Notes / deferred

- Hardware protocol bridges (Art-Net/sACN, VISCA, DMX, OSC, MIDI) and the actor/process queue (Whisper, Python sidecars) from SPEC §2 are still on the roadmap — they need desktop-only system libraries that would break the mobile/embedded/wasm surfaces we just finished certifying. They'll land as feature-gated desktop-only modules (`hardware`, `actors`) when the first consumer needs them.
- No ESP32 simulator was exercised. `embedded = ["crdt"]` is still the placeholder for that path; `cargo test --features embedded` runs on the host toolchain and validates the minimal kernel compiles without any desktop-only dep leaking in.
- VFS currently uses `std::fs` under a configurable root. A future S3 / GCS / content-delivery adapter would plug in via `builder.set_vfs_manager(...)` exposing the same command surface.

## ADR 002 Phase 1 — PrismFile + LanguageContribution (Complete — 2026-04-11)

Phase 1 of ADR 002 introduced the two new abstractions (§A1 and §A2). Phase 4 (see entry above) collapsed the legacy registries and retired the compat bridge.

### What landed

1. **`packages/prism-core/src/language/document/prism-file.ts`** — `PrismFile` + `FileBody` discriminated union (`text` | `graph` | `binary`) plus `createTextFile`/`createGraphFile`/`createBinaryFile` constructors and `isTextBody`/`isGraphBody`/`isBinaryBody` narrowing guards. Imports `LoroText`, `GraphObject`, `BinaryRef`, and `DocumentSchema` — the first type to formally tie all of them together.
2. **`packages/prism-core/src/language/registry/language-contribution.ts`** — `LanguageContribution<TRenderer, TEditorExtension>` interface covering id/extensions/displayName/mimeType, optional parse/serialize/syntaxProvider/codemirrorExtensions, a `LanguageSurface<TRenderer>` (defaultMode/availableModes/inlineTokens/renderers) and optional `LanguageCodegen`. Generic over renderer + editor extension types so `@prism/core/language` stays React- and CodeMirror-free; Studio specializes later.
3. **`packages/prism-core/src/language/registry/compat.ts`** — the compatibility bridge. `contributionFromLegacy(language, surface)` adapts any existing `LanguageDefinition` + `DocumentContributionDef` pair (either half may be null) into a `LanguageContribution`. `resolveContribution({ languages, surfaces, filename, documentType, languageId })` resolves both registries from common keys and returns a unified view. Drops diagnostics on parse (Phase 4 reconnects them) and falls back to a code-only surface when the language has no registered `DocumentContributionDef`.
4. **Subpath exports** — `@prism/core/document` and `@prism/core/language-registry` added to `packages/prism-core/package.json`. Tsconfig paths already cover `src/language/*`, so no tsconfig change was needed.
5. **Tests** — 20 new tests across `prism-file.test.ts` (10) and `compat.test.ts` (10). Covers: body constructors, narrowing guards, exhaustive switch over `FileBody`, schema + metadata carry-through, round-trip parse/serialize through the bridge, missing-surface fallback, missing-language pass-through, explicit-documentType override, unknown-filename null return, and the bridge throwing when both inputs are null.
6. **Docs** — `packages/prism-core/CLAUDE.md` + `README.md` list `document/` and `registry/` under the `language/` category with ADR-002 §A1/§A2 cross-references.

### Status

- `pnpm --filter @prism/core typecheck` — green.
- `pnpm test` — **187 test files, 3663 tests passing** (+20 from 185/3643 pre-Phase-1).
- `PrismFile` and `LanguageContribution` are now consumed by Phase 2 (Luau fold) and Phase 4 (registry collapse) — see ADR 002 Phases 2–4 entry above.

## ADR 002 Structural Reorganization (Complete — 2026-04-11)

Moved `@prism/core` from its old `src/layer1/` + `src/layer2/` binary split into **8 domain categories** under `src/`:

```
foundation → language/identity → kernel/network → interaction/domain → bindings
```

- `foundation/` — pure data: object-model, persistence, vfs, crdt-stores, batch, clipboard, template, undo, loro-bridge
- `language/` — expression, forms, syntax, luau, facet
- `kernel/` — actor, automation, builder, config, plugin, plugin-bundles, state-machine
- `interaction/` — atom, layout, lens, input, activity, notification, search, view (React-free)
- `identity/` — did, encryption, trust, manifest
- `network/` — relay, presence, session, discovery, server
- `domain/` — flux, graph-analysis, timeline
- `bindings/` — codemirror, puck, kbar, xyflow, react-shell, viewport3d, audio (the only layer allowed to import React / DOM / WebGL)

### What landed

1. **8 category directories** created under `packages/prism-core/src/`; every subsystem moved with `git mv` so history is preserved.
2. **Path aliases extended** in `packages/prism-core/tsconfig.json` so `@prism/core/<subsystem>` resolves inside the package as well as from consumers. `rootDir: ".."` fixes TS2209 now that `package.json` no longer has a `"."` entry.
3. **Vitest uses `vite-tsconfig-paths`** (`vitest.config.ts`) instead of a 60-line hand-maintained alias list.
4. **Cross-category relative imports eliminated.** Two scripts under `/tmp/` rewrote 115/383 files to `@prism/core/<subsystem>` form, then corrected folder-name → public-export mismatches (`did→identity`, `crdt-stores→stores`, `react-shell→shell`, `xyflow→graph`). Intra-category sibling imports stay relative.
5. **`@prism/core/layer1` barrel retired.** Studio kernel, panels, and tests split their old catch-all imports into specific subsystem imports (`@prism/core/plugin-bundles`, `@prism/core/facet`, `@prism/core/view`, `@prism/core/manifest`, `@prism/core/luau`, `@prism/core/flux`). The `layer1` and `layer2` subpath exports no longer exist.
6. **Docs refreshed** — `packages/prism-core/CLAUDE.md`, `packages/prism-core/README.md`, `SPEC.md` §1, root `README.md`, `packages/prism-studio/CLAUDE.md`/`README.md`, `packages/prism-relay/CLAUDE.md` now describe the 8-category structure instead of the Layer 1 / Layer 2 framing.

### Status

- `pnpm typecheck` — green across all 6 packages.
- `pnpm test` — **185 test files, 3643 tests passing**.
- All four ADR-002 phases (1–4) are now complete on top of this structure.

### Note on historical phase entries below

The phase entries below this section were written when the codebase was still split into `layer1/` and `layer2/`. Paths like `layer1/syntax/...`, `layer2/viewport3d/...`, etc. are **historical**. The canonical current paths live under the 8 domain categories and are tracked in the subpath export table in `packages/prism-core/README.md`.

## Luau full-moon AST Integration (Complete — 2026-04-10)

Ripped regex-based Luau parsing out of panels + debugger, replaced with a
lossless AST via Kampfkarren/full-moon compiled to WASM. Plugged into the
Helm-inherited syntax/codegen system as a `LanguageDefinition` +
`SyntaxProvider` rather than a standalone module.

### What landed

1. **Rust crate `packages/prism-core/native/luau-parser/`** wraps `full_moon`
   (v1.2, `luau` feature) via `wasm-bindgen` + `serde-wasm-bindgen`. Exposes
   four functions: `parse`, `findUiCalls`, `findStatementLines`, `validate`.
   Serializable `JsSyntaxNode`/`UiCall`/`UiArg`/`Diagnostic` types mirror the
   shapes Prism's normalizers expect. 8 native Rust tests cover statement line
   detection (including if/while/for recursion and multi-line strings),
   `ui.*(...)` extraction with nested children, and parse error reporting.
2. **WASM build** via `wasm-pack build --target web` — 248KB optimized
   `prism_luau_parser_bg.wasm` + glue committed under
   `src/layer1/syntax/luau/pkg/` so Vitest/Vite don't need the Rust toolchain.
3. **TS wrappers at `packages/prism-core/src/layer1/syntax/luau/`**:
   - `wasm-loader.ts` — idempotent async init with Node/browser environment
     detection (Node uses `fs/promises.readFile`, browser uses `fetch`);
     `ensureLuauParserLoaded` / `getLuauParserSync` / `isLuauParserReady`
   - `luau-ast.ts` — async + sync helpers (`parseLuau`, `findUiCalls`,
     `findStatementLines`, `validateLuau`) with defensive normalizers for the
     untyped wasm-bindgen output
   - `luau-language.ts` — `createLuauLanguageDefinition()` implements the sync
     `LanguageDefinition` interface; reports init-not-ready or parser errors
     into `ProcessorContext.diagnostics` and returns an empty root so the
     pipeline continues
   - `luau-provider.ts` — `createLuauSyntaxProvider()` implements the
     `SyntaxProvider` interface with AST-backed `diagnose()` and a 9-item
     `ui.*` completion list surfaced after `ui.`
   - `index.ts` — convenience `initLuauSyntax()` + public re-exports
4. **Re-exports** from `@prism/core/syntax` covering every public Luau symbol
   so consumers never import `./luau/...` paths directly.
5. **26 Vitest tests** in `luau-ast.test.ts` covering loader idempotency,
   `findUiCalls` (flat / nested children / empty source / parser errors /
   sync), `findStatementLines` (flat / if-else recursion / multiline string
   resilience / sync), `validateLuau` (clean + error), `parseLuau`, the
   `LanguageDefinition` (id/extensions, clean parse, error reporting), and
   the `SyntaxProvider` (name, diagnose, ui.* completions, hover=null).
6. **`luau-facet-panel.tsx` rewrite** — deleted ~270 lines of hand-rolled
   parser (`parseNodeList` / `parseCall` / `parseLeafCall` /
   `parseSectionCall` / `parseContainerCall` / `parseVoidCall` /
   `parseString` / `skipWhitespaceAndComments` / `skipToClosingParen`).
   `parseLuauUi(source)` is now a thin sync adapter: `findUiCallsSync` →
   `uiCallToNode` → `UINode` tree. Positional args are unpacked onto named
   `props` based on kind (label/button→text, badge→text+color,
   input→placeholder+value, section→title, etc). The `UINode` /
   `ParseResult` / `renderUINode` exports are preserved so `canvas-panel`
   and `layout-panel` continue to work unchanged.
7. **Async-init React hook** — the module kicks off `initLuauSyntax()` at
   load time, and a new `useLuauParserReady()` hook (built on
   `useSyncExternalStore`) flips from `false` to `true` once the WASM
   parser is ready. `LuauFacetPanel`, `canvas-panel`'s `LuauBlockRenderer`,
   and a new `PuckLuauBlockRender` component (extracted from
   `layout-panel` so the Puck render callback is a real component) all
   subscribe to it and re-render once the parser is live.
8. **12 Vitest tests** in `packages/prism-studio/src/panels/luau-facet-panel.test.ts`
   cover the `parseLuauUi` adapter: empty source, every element kind with
   its positional-arg → named-prop mapping (label/button/badge/input/
   section/row/column/spacer/divider), nested children, parser errors,
   and comments.
9. **`luau-debugger.ts` instrumentation rewrite** — `instrumentSource` is
   now async and built on `findStatementLines` from `@prism/core/syntax`.
   It only injects `__prism_trace(n)` on lines that begin a Luau statement
   per the full-moon AST, so (a) multi-line string literals no longer
   receive spurious trace calls inside their continuation lines, and
   (b) multi-line statements are traced once at their first line instead
   of on every continuation. `buildScript` cascades async. 3 regression
   tests in `luau-debugger.test.ts` cover multi-line strings, multi-line
   function calls, and nested if/then/else statements.

Full suite: **3643 tests** passing (up from 3602).

## Lua → Luau Migration (Complete — 2026-04-10)

Full codebase migration from Lua 5.4 (wasmoon) to Luau (luau-web / mlua+luau):

- **Browser runtime**: replaced `wasmoon` with `luau-web` (`LuauState.createAsync`)
- **Daemon runtime**: mlua feature flag `lua54` → `luau`; added `Value::Integer` handling; switched to `into_function().call()` for reliable multi-return capture
- **IPC**: `lua_exec` → `luau_exec`; `prism.lua` → `prism.luau`; `lua.exec` → `luau.exec`
- **Debugger**: source instrumentation approach (`__prism_trace`) unchanged; guarded `debug.getlocal` for environments where it's unavailable (luau-web sandbox)
- **Types**: `LuaResult` → `LuauResult`, `LuaExecRequest` → `LuauExecRequest`, all `Lua*` public types renamed to `Luau*`
- **Exports**: `@prism/core/lua` → `@prism/core/luau`; `.d.lua` → `.d.luau`
- **Tests**: 3602 TS + 33 Rust unit + 7 integration + 12 wasm E2E — all green

## Prism Daemon: Cross-Platform Kernel + DI Builder (Complete — 2026-04-08)

Goal: port Studio's self-replicating kernel paradigm to `prism-daemon` so the
same Rust engine can run on any device — desktop (Tauri), mobile
(Capacitor/FFI), headless (CLI) — with modules plugged in via a fluent
builder instead of being hardcoded.

### What landed

1. **`CommandRegistry` (`src/registry.rs`)** — the transport-agnostic IPC
   layer. Maps name → `Arc<dyn Fn(JsonValue) -> Result<JsonValue, CommandError>>`.
   Every transport adapter (Tauri `#[command]`, UniFFI, stdio CLI, future
   HTTP) funnels through `kernel.invoke(name, payload)`. Mirrors Studio's
   `LensRegistry` role.
2. **`DaemonModule` trait (`src/module.rs`)** — Rust analogue of
   `LensBundle` / `PluginBundle`. `install(&self, builder: &mut DaemonBuilder)`
   self-registers the module's commands + stashes any shared service on the
   builder.
3. **`DaemonInitializer` trait + `InitializerHandle` (`src/initializer.rs`)**
    — post-boot side-effect hooks, equivalent of `StudioInitializer`. Run
   in install order after the kernel exists, torn down in reverse on
   `dispose()`.
4. **`DaemonBuilder` (`src/builder.rs`)** — fluent builder:
   `DaemonBuilder::new().with_crdt().with_luau().with_build().with_watcher()
   .with_module(custom).with_initializer(init).build()`. `with_defaults()`
   installs every module the current feature flags allow. Tauri/CLI/mobile
   all use the identical shape.
5. **`DaemonKernel` (`src/kernel.rs`)** — cheaply-cloneable runtime
   (everything behind `Arc`). Exposes `invoke`, `capabilities`,
   `installed_modules`, `doc_manager()`, `watcher_manager()`, `dispose()`.
   Hot paths can skip JSON round-trips by grabbing the `Arc<DocManager>`
   directly — same idea as Studio's direct `kernel.store` access.
6. **Feature-gated built-in modules (`src/modules/*`)**:
   - `crdt_module.rs` → `prism.crdt` → `crdt.{write,read,export,import}`
   - `luau_module.rs` → `prism.luau` → `luau.exec`
   - `build_module.rs` → `prism.build` → `build.run_step` (emit-file /
     run-command / invoke-ipc)
   - `watcher_module.rs` → `prism.watcher` → `watcher.{watch,poll,stop}`
     backed by a new `WatcherManager` that multiplexes `notify`
     subscriptions by ID.
7. **Feature matrix** (`Cargo.toml`):
   - `full` (default) — every capability, enables the CLI bin
   - `mobile` — `crdt + luau` only (iOS bans process spawning, no notify)
   - `embedded` — `crdt` only (minimum kernel)
   Individual flags: `crdt`, `luau`, `build`, `watcher`, `cli`. Mobile /
   embedded builds don't contain the code they can't run.
8. **`DocManager` extracted to `src/doc_manager.rs`** behind the `crdt`
   feature. Injectable via `builder.set_doc_manager(Arc<DocManager>)` so
   hosts can preload docs from disk before booting the kernel.
9. **Standalone `prism-daemond` bin (`src/bin/prism_daemond.rs`)** —
   minimal stdio-JSON loop proving the kernel runs detached from Tauri.
   Emits a capabilities banner on startup; reads one JSON request per
   line; exposes `daemon.capabilities` + `daemon.modules` alongside
   module-contributed commands.
10. **Studio Tauri shell migrated** (`packages/prism-studio/src-tauri/
    src/{main,commands}.rs`). `main.rs` constructs the kernel via the
    builder and `.manage()`s `Arc<DaemonKernel>`. Tauri commands forward
    to `kernel.invoke(...)` for generic paths and to
    `kernel.doc_manager()` for the CRDT hot path. New
    `daemon_capabilities` command exposes kernel introspection to the
    frontend. Old `prism_daemon::commands::*` legacy shim was removed
    entirely — call sites now import from `prism_daemon::modules::*`.
11. **Tests**: 33 unit tests across `registry` + `modules` + 7 integration
    tests in `tests/kernel_integration.rs` covering builder composition,
    custom modules, initializer ordering, kernel clone/share semantics,
    and empty-kernel behavior. `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
    passes. `cargo build --no-default-features --features mobile` and
    `--features embedded` both compile.

### Studio ↔ Daemon mapping

| Studio (TS)              | Daemon (Rust)            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| `createStudioKernel`     | `DaemonBuilder::build`   |
| `LensBundle`             | `DaemonModule`           |
| `StudioInitializer`      | `DaemonInitializer`      |
| `LensRegistry`           | `CommandRegistry`        |
| `installLensBundles`     | `DaemonBuilder::with_module` |
| `installInitializers`    | `DaemonBuilder::with_initializer` |
| `kernel.dispose()`       | `kernel.dispose()`       |
| `kernel.shellStore`      | `kernel.doc_manager()` + `kernel.watcher_manager()` |

The self-replicating paradigm now spans the entire stack: Studio composes
apps + kernels with bundles + initializers; the Daemon composes
capabilities with modules + initializers; both emit builds via the same
`BuildStep` wire format flowing through the build module.

## Kernel Composition & Self-Registering Bundles (Complete — 2026-04-08)

Goal: make layers flow strictly bottom-up. Apps don't know about lenses,
lenses don't know about apps, templates/seed data don't live in `App.tsx`.
Closes every DI / registration gap between the host and its subsystems.

### What landed

1. **`LensBundle` in `@prism/core/lens`**. New `lens-install.ts` adds
   `LensBundle<TComponent>`, `LensInstallContext<TComponent>`,
   `installLensBundles`, and `defineLensBundle`. Generic over component
   type so Layer 1 stays React-free. Covered by `lens-install.test.ts`
   (5 cases). Re-exported from `@prism/core/lens/index.ts`.
2. **Studio React specialization** (`src/lenses/bundle.ts`). A thin
   `ComponentType`-pinned re-export of the generic primitive so panels
   get a `LensBundle` / `defineLensBundle` with the correct component
   type without leaking React into Layer 1.
3. **40 self-registering panels**. Every file in `src/panels/*.tsx` now
   exports both its React component and its `xxxLensBundle` right next
   to the manifest. `src/lenses/index.tsx` collapsed from a manifest +
   component-map aggregator into a 40-line bundle aggregator with a
   single `createBuiltinLensBundles()` export.
4. **Kernel owns the lens lifecycle**. `createStudioKernel()` now takes
   `{ lensBundles?, initializers? }`. It creates its own `LensRegistry`,
   `lensComponents: Map<LensId, ComponentType>`, and `shellStore`, runs
   `installLensBundles`, and exposes all three as kernel fields.
   `dispose()` unwinds bundle disposers in reverse order.
5. **`StudioInitializer` pipeline**. New `kernel/initializer.ts`
   (`install({ kernel }) => uninstall` interface + `installInitializers`
   helper). Initializers run AFTER the kernel's return object exists, so
   they can freely call `kernel.registerTemplate`, `kernel.createObject`,
   etc. Symmetric with `PluginBundle` / `LensBundle` but scoped to
   post-boot side effects.
6. **`kernel/builtin-initializers.ts`**. Moves the old top-of-`App.tsx`
   seeders into three self-installing bundles:
   - `pageTemplatesInitializer` — blog + landing page `ObjectTemplate`s
   - `sectionTemplatesInitializer` — delegates to
     `registerSectionTemplates(kernel)`
   - `demoWorkspaceInitializer` — seeds Home + About pages into an empty
     store, clears undo history, selects the home page
   Exposed via `createBuiltinInitializers()`.
7. **`App.tsx` collapsed from ~400 → ~140 lines**. No more
   `seedDemoData`, `registerSeedTemplates`, or parallel lens-registry
   wiring. Just:
   ```ts
   const kernel = createStudioKernel({
     lensBundles: createBuiltinLensBundles(),
     initializers: createBuiltinInitializers(),
   });
   const { lensRegistry, lensComponents, shellStore } = kernel;
   ```
8. **Export surface**. `src/kernel/index.ts` re-exports
   `StudioKernelOptions`, `StudioInitializer`, `StudioInitializerContext`,
   `installInitializers`, `createBuiltinInitializers`, and the three
   individual initializers so profile-aware hosts can cherry-pick.

### Verification

- `pnpm --filter @prism/core typecheck` clean
- `pnpm --filter @prism/studio typecheck` clean
- `pnpm --filter @prism/studio exec vitest run src/kernel src/lenses` —
  254 tests green (including 113 `studio-kernel.test.ts` cases against
  the new options shape)
- `pnpm exec vitest run packages/prism-core/src/layer1/lens` —
  33 tests green across `lens-install.test.ts`, `lens-registry.test.ts`,
  `shell-store.test.ts`
- The only remaining red in `pnpm --filter @prism/studio test` is
  Vitest accidentally picking up `e2e/*.spec.ts` Playwright files —
  pre-existing glob config issue, unrelated to this work.

### Docs updated

- `SPEC.md` — new `Kernel Composition & Self-Registering Bundles`
  subsection inside "Studio as a Self-Replicating Meta-Builder";
  bundle-kind table; App Profile filter bullet now lists `LensBundle`s
  and `StudioInitializer`s alongside `PluginBundle`s.
- `README.md` — Layer 1 Lens Shell row mentions
  `LensBundle`/`installLensBundles`/`defineLensBundle`; new Philosophy
  bullet: "Layers Flow Bottom-Up".
- `packages/prism-core/CLAUDE.md` — `@prism/core/lens` description
  covers the new bundle primitives and the Layer-1 React-free rationale.
- `packages/prism-studio/CLAUDE.md` — kernel description rewritten
  around `createStudioKernel({ lensBundles, initializers })`; new
  `initializer.ts` + `builtin-initializers.ts` kernel entries; Lenses
  section rewritten around the self-registering bundle pattern with a
  2-step "adding a new lens" recipe.
- `docs/dev/current-plan.md` — this section.

## Studio Checklist — Full Closeout (Complete — 2026-04-08)

Every tier in `docs/dev/studio-checklist.md` is now implemented, wired into a
registered lens, and exercised by both vitest unit tests and Playwright E2E
specs. Totals: 3513 unit tests across 174 files, `tsc --noEmit` clean
workspace-wide.

### New in this sprint

- **3E Design Tokens** — `design-tokens-panel.tsx` + `kernel/design-tokens.ts`
  (shift+T). CSS variables for colors/spacing/fonts.
- **4A/4B/4C/4D Expressions + Bindings** — `inspector-panel.tsx`
  `ComputedFieldDisplay` runs `EntityFieldDef.expression` via
  `@prism/core/expression`; the Expression Bar drives a
  `createSyntaxEngine()` completion dropdown; `kernel/data-binding.ts`
  handles `[obj:pageTitle]` resolution and `visibleWhen` gating on the canvas.
- **5B/5D Section Templates + Save-as-Template** —
  `kernel/section-templates.ts` registers six blueprints; Inspector exposes
  "Save as Template" via new `studio-kernel.templateFromObject()`.
- **7A Rich Text Toolbar** — `editor-panel.tsx` Markdown toolbar, backed by
  the pure `computeMarkdownEdit()` helper (7 vitest cases).
- **7D Media / VFS Upload** — `assets-panel.tsx` `handleImportBinary()` reads
  `File` → VFS → auto-creates image blocks when the parent is a
  section/page.
- **8B Form Builder** — `form-builder-panel.tsx` (shift+G). Composes form
  inputs under the nearest container ancestor; walks parent chain.
- **8D Multi-Page Nav** — `site-nav-panel.tsx` + `siteNavDef` /
  `breadcrumbsDef` in `kernel/entities.ts`. Pure `buildSiteNav()` helper
  covered by `site-nav-panel.test.ts`.
- **8E Peer Cursors** — `components/peer-cursors-overlay.tsx` renders
  `PeerCursorsBar` at the top of the canvas and exports
  `PeerSelectionBadge` + a pure `groupPeerSelections()` helper. Driven
  entirely by `usePresence()`. Tests: `peer-cursors-overlay.test.ts`.
- **9A Entity Builder** — `entity-builder-panel.tsx` (shift+E). UI for
  authoring `EntityDef`s at runtime and registering them into
  `kernel.registry`.
- **9B Relationship Builder** — `relationship-builder-panel.tsx` (shift+R).
  UI for authoring `EdgeTypeDef`s (behavior / color / source-target type
  restrictions). Uses conditional assignment for `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.

### E2E coverage

`e2e/new-panels.spec.ts` (new) adds Playwright coverage for design-tokens,
form-builder, site-nav, entity-builder, relationship-builder, publish, and
the canvas peer-cursors bar. Pattern: open the lens via its activity icon,
assert the panel `data-testid` is visible, then interact with at least one
key control (e.g. add a draft field in the Entity Builder).

### Docs updated

- `docs/dev/studio-checklist.md` — every Tier 3-9 item flipped to `[x]`
  with file references; added Verification section.
- `packages/prism-studio/CLAUDE.md` — new panel list entries.
- `docs/dev/current-plan.md` — this section.

## Styling System + Publish Workflow + Rich Media (Complete — 2026-04-08)

Three more checklist tiers land together because they all share the same
block-style foundation: a per-block `BlockStyleData` bag that every renderer
and the HTML exporter apply uniformly.

### Tier 3 — Block styling + typography (`block-style.ts`)

- [x] `BlockStyleData` shape — background, text color, padding/margin
  (X/Y), border (width/color/radius), shadow (preset or raw), font
  (family/size/weight/line-height/letter-spacing), text-align, flex
  (display/direction/gap/align/justify)
- [x] `STYLE_FIELD_DEFS` — single shared array spread into the existing
  `section`, `heading`, `text-block`, `button`, and `card` entity defs
  so the inspector now shows `Style` and `Typography` groups for every
  core block. Replaces the old section-only `padding`/`background` enums.
- [x] `computeBlockStyle()` — pure bag → `CSSProperties` (shadow preset
  resolver, stringy-number coercion, 0-padding tolerance)
- [x] `extractBlockStyle()` / `mergeCss()` — extractor + merger used by
  both `BlockWrapper` and `SectionBlock` in `canvas-panel.tsx` so every
  block picks up the author's style overrides on top of the base CSS

### Tier 6 — Publish & Export (`page-export.ts`, `publish-panel.tsx`)

- [x] **6A HTML Export** — `exportPageToHtml()` walks the page tree
  into dependency-free HTML + default inline CSS, with per-node
  `blockStyleAttr()` emitting sanitized inline styles, safe for offline
  viewing. Escapes all text + attributes (`escapeHtml`/`escapeAttr`).
  Supports `fragmentOnly` output and CSS overrides.
- [x] **6B JSON Export** — `exportPageToJson()` emits a deterministic
  `prism-page/v1` snapshot (`ExportedNode` tree with inlined children in
  position order, deleted objects skipped, data cloned).
- [x] **6C Publish Workflow** — `nextStatus()` / `statusColor()` pure
  helpers drive a `draft → review → published` transition on the page's
  `status` field. Advance / Back-to-Draft buttons in the Publish panel
  update the kernel object, with colored status pills.
- [x] **6D Preview Mode** — Publish panel toggles an inline preview that
  runs the same `renderNodeHtml()` pipeline as the exporter (so authors
  see exactly what the exported HTML contains).
- [x] **Publish lens** — Lens #29, `Shift+U`, rocket icon 🚀, registered
  in `lenses/index.tsx`. Resolves the current page from selection by
  walking parentId, drops a placeholder when nothing is selected.

### Tier 7C / 7D — Code + Media blocks

- [x] **code-block** — `CodeBlockRenderer` with language label, caption,
  line-number gutter (auto-width), wrap toggle, dark theme, dependency-
  free pre/code. Pure helpers `splitCodeLines()` / `gutterWidth()`.
- [x] **video-widget** — `VideoWidgetRenderer` backed by native HTML5
  video, poster + caption + width/height (clamped), controls/autoplay/
  loop/muted flags. Refuses non-http(s) URLs via `isSafeMediaUrl`.
- [x] **audio-widget** — `AudioWidgetRenderer` backed by native HTML5
  audio, same URL allow-list + captions + control flags.
- [x] Three new defs registered in `entities.ts`, wired into Puck
  (`layout-panel.tsx`) and the canvas switch (`canvas-panel.tsx`), and
  covered by the widget-registration check in `studio-kernel.test.ts`.
- [x] HTML exporter knows about `code-block`, `video-widget`,
  `audio-widget`, `iframe-widget`, `markdown-widget`, `divider`,
  `spacer` so exported pages render all the same content as the canvas.

## App Builder Widgets — Form / Layout / Display / Content (Complete — 2026-04-08)

Prism Studio now ships 15 additional drag-and-drop Puck widgets so that
non-programmers can assemble real apps (forms, dashboards, docs) without
reaching for code. All widgets follow the established pattern: entity
def in `entities.ts` → renderer in `components/` → Puck config in
`layout-panel.tsx` → canvas block + switch case in `canvas-panel.tsx`.

### Form Inputs (6)

- [x] **text-input** — label, placeholder, default value, input type
  (text/email/url/tel/password), required flag, help text
- [x] **textarea-input** — multi-line with configurable rows
- [x] **select-input** — dropdown; options accept either `a,b,c`,
  `value:Label` pairs, or a JSON array
- [x] **checkbox-input** — labeled boolean
- [x] **number-input** — min/max/step/default
- [x] **date-input** — date / datetime-local / time kinds

### Layout Primitives (3)

- [x] **columns** — 1-6 column grid with gap + cross-axis alignment,
  empty-state placeholders so the widget is visible on first drop
- [x] **divider** — solid/dashed/dotted with thickness, color,
  spacing, optional centered label
- [x] **spacer** — vertical or horizontal gap, clamped to 0-512px

### Data Display (4)

- [x] **stat-widget** — KPI card computing count/sum/avg/min/max over
  `kernel.store.allObjects()` filtered by `collectionType`, with
  prefix/suffix, decimals, and thousands separator
- [x] **badge** — neutral/info/success/warning/danger tones, optional
  emoji icon, solid or outline
- [x] **alert** — callout box with title + message, the same tone
  palette, auto-chosen icon per tone
- [x] **progress-bar** — labeled bar with percent display and tone
  color, value/max clamped to [0,1]

### Content (2)

- [x] **markdown-widget** — dependency-free markdown → HTML with
  headings, lists, blockquotes, fenced code blocks, horizontal rules,
  inline bold/italic/code/links (escaped)
- [x] **iframe-widget** — embed http(s) URL with sandbox attrs
  (`allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-popups`),
  javascript/data/file schemes rejected

### Files touched

- `packages/prism-studio/src/components/form-input-renderers.tsx` (new)
- `packages/prism-studio/src/components/layout-primitive-renderers.tsx` (new)
- `packages/prism-studio/src/components/data-display-renderers.tsx` (new)

- `packages/prism-studio/src/components/*.test.ts` (4 new test files)
- `packages/prism-studio/src/kernel/entities.ts` — 15 new EntityDefs
  registered
- `packages/prism-studio/src/panels/layout-panel.tsx` — 15 new Puck
  component configs with live-bound renderers
- `packages/prism-studio/src/panels/canvas-panel.tsx` — 15 new canvas
  block components + switch cases in `ComponentBlock`
- `packages/prism-studio/src/kernel/studio-kernel.test.ts` — registry
  coverage extended

## Foundation Widgets + Core Enhancements (Complete — 2026-04-08)

Expansion of Prism's foundation: expression/field primitives, document surface
completion, a suite of composable Puck widgets, and relay-side template/email
endpoints. All new views land as drag-and-drop Puck widgets in Layout/Canvas —
the legacy ViewMode registry is dead.

### Phase A — Layer 1 primitives

- [x] **A1** Expression builtins — string (`len`, `lower`, `upper`, `trim`, `concat`, `left`, `right`, `mid`, `substitute`), date (`today`, `now`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `datediff`), aggregate (`sum`, `avg`, `count`) wired into `evaluator.ts` + `syntax-engine.ts` autocomplete
- [x] **A2** `"formula"` field type with `expression` body in `FieldSchema`
- [x] **A3** `"lookup" | "rollup"` entity field types + `field-resolver.ts` dispatcher for formula/lookup/rollup computation across edge relations
- [x] **A4** `FacetSlot` extended with `tab` / `popover` / `slide` container kinds; `FacetDefinitionBuilder.addTabContainer()` / `addPopoverContainer()` / `addSlideContainer()`
- [x] **A5** `EmailAction` (`email:send`) with `{{field}}` interpolation alongside existing automation actions
- [x] **A6** `"stream"` added to `EdgeBehavior` union

### Phase B — Document Surface completion

- [x] **B1** `FormSurface` — YAML/JSON source → auto-derived field schema → round-trip form
- [x] **B2** `CsvSurface` — quoted fields, TSV autodetect, contentEditable table, add/delete row/column
- [x] **B3** `ReportSurface` — grouped reports with count/sum/avg/min/max summaries, print-ready
- [x] **B4** `print-renderer.ts` — `@page`/`@media print` CSS from `PrintConfig`, hidden-iframe browser print trigger
- [x] **B5** `luau-markdown-plugin.ts` — inline ```luau fenced blocks executed and rendered into markdown previews

### Phase C — Puck widgets

All seven widgets follow the existing `facet-view` / `spatial-canvas` / `data-portal`
pattern: entity def in `entities.ts`, renderer component under `components/`, wired
into both `layout-panel.tsx` (Puck builder) and `canvas-panel.tsx` (canvas preview).

- [x] **C1** `kanban-widget` — HTML5 drag-drop groups cards by a field; drop reassigns the group value via kernel.updateObject (no `@dnd-kit` dep)
- [x] **C2** `calendar-widget` — CSS grid month view with event dots, prev/next/today navigation, click-to-create
- [x] **C3** `chart-widget` — pure SVG bar/line/pie/area with count/sum/avg/min/max aggregations (no `recharts` dep)
- [x] **C4** `map-widget` — SVG lat/lng scatter with auto-bounds projection (swap in `react-leaflet` later for tile layers)
- [x] **C5** `tab-container` — horizontal tab bar, JSON-array or CSV label parsing
- [x] **C6** `popover-widget` + `slide-panel` — trigger-button popover and collapsible accordion
- [x] **C7** `FacetViewRenderer` — renders nested `tab`/`popover`/`slide` slots from FacetDefinitions
- [x] **C8** `list-widget` / `table-widget` / `card-grid-widget` / `report-widget` — data-driven data view widgets bound to a `collectionType`; renderers live in `components/*-widget-renderer.tsx` with exported pure helpers (`readListField`, `parseTableColumns`/`readCellValue`/`sortObjects`, `clampColumnWidth`, `buildReportGroups`/`computeAggregate`/`formatAggregate`). Replaces the legacy `record-browser-panel.tsx` (deleted) and the object-explorer view-mode switcher — all "views" are now composable Puck widgets.

### Phase D — Independent items

- [x] **D1** Import Panel (Lens #28, Shift+Y) — CSV/TSV/JSON file drop, column→field mapping table, 10-row preview, bulk `kernel.createObject` (pure helpers exported for tests)
- [x] **D2** `GET /api/portals/:id/export` — bundles portal manifest + backing collection snapshot into a downloadable JSON template
- [x] **D3** `POST /api/email/send` + `GET /api/email/status` — pluggable `EmailTransport` interface with `createMemoryEmailTransport` for tests; `{{field}}` subject/body interpolation; 503 unconfigured, 502 on delivery failure
- [x] **D4** `StreamEdgeComponent` — animated dashed bezier (`@keyframes prism-stream-dash`) registered in `prismEdgeTypes`

### Test Summary

| Suite | Tests | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Vitest (full repo) | 3359 | Pass (159 files) |
| New colocated tests this plan | 143 | Pass |

Pre-existing TS errors in `kernel/builder-manager.ts` + `panels/app-builder-panel.tsx` (staged WIP, not part of this plan) remain; full-repo typecheck is otherwise clean.

## Self-Replicating Studio (Complete)

Prism Studio is now a meta-builder: it can produce focused Prism apps (Flux, Lattice, Cadence, Grip), Studio itself, and Relay deployments as build targets — while remaining the universal host. See `SPEC.md` § "Studio as a Self-Replicating Meta-Builder".

### Completed

- [x] SPEC.md — documented App Profiles, BuildTargets, BuildPlan execution model, App Builder Lens
- [x] Layer 1 builder primitives (`@prism/core/builder`) — `AppProfile`, `BuildTarget`, `BuildStep` (emit-file/run-command/invoke-ipc), `BuildPlan`, `BuildRun`, `serializeAppProfile`/`parseAppProfile`, `createBuildPlan`, `serializeBuildPlan`
- [x] Six built-in profiles — `studio` (universal host, no plugin filter), `flux` (work/finance/crm), `lattice` (assets/platform), `cadence` (life/platform), `grip` (work/assets/platform), `relay` (no plugins, 6 relay modules, glass flip disabled)
- [x] Six build targets — `web`, `tauri`, `capacitor-ios`, `capacitor-android`, `relay-node`, `relay-docker` — each with deterministic step list and artifact descriptors
- [x] Studio `BuilderManager` — profile registry, active-profile pin (null = universal host), planBuild/planBuilds, runPlan with executor injection, run history, subscriptions
- [x] Two executors — `createDryRunExecutor` (default; emit-file→success, run-command→skipped, no daemon required) and `createTauriExecutor({ invoke })` (dispatches via `invoke('run_build_step', ...)`, stops on first failure)
- [x] App Builder Lens (#28, Shift+B, 🏭) — profile grid, target pills, preview plan, dry-run build, run history, raw BuildPlan JSON
- [x] `useBuilder` kernel hook — version key tracks profiles/active/runs/last status
- [x] `@prism/core/builder` wired into root `vitest.config.ts` alias map and `package.json` exports

### Test Summary

| Suite | Tests | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Vitest (`@prism/core/builder`) | 20 | Pass |
| Vitest (Studio `builder-manager`) | 29 | Pass |
| Vitest (full repo) | 3218 | Pass |
| Playwright (`app-builder.spec.ts`) | 11 | Pass |

## Phase 8: Automation Engine, Prism Manifest (Complete)

Two systems for workflow automation and manifest-driven workspace definition. All pure TypeScript, zero React.

### Terminology (from SPEC.md)

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Vault** | Encrypted local directory — the physical security boundary. Contains Collections and Manifests. |
| **Collection** | Typed CRDT array (e.g. `Contacts`, `Tasks`). Holds the actual data. |
| **Manifest** | JSON file with weak references to Collections. A "workspace" is just a Manifest pointing to data nodes. Multiple manifests can reference the same collection with different filters. |
| **Shell** | The IDE chrome that renders whatever a Manifest references. No fixed layout. |

### Completed

  - Execution tracking: AutomationRun with per-action results, status (success/failed/skipped/partial)
- [x] **Prism Manifest** (`layer1/manifest/`) — workspace definition file
  - `PrismManifest` — on-disk `.prism.json` containing weak references to Collections in a Vault
  - `CollectionRef` — a manifest's pointer to a typed CRDT collection, optionally with type/tag/sort filters
  - `StorageConfig` — Loro CRDT (default), memory, fs backends (adapted from legacy sqlite/http/postgres)
  - `SchemaConfig` — ordered schema module references (`@prism/core`, relative paths)
  - `SyncConfig` — off/manual/auto modes with peer addresses for CRDT sync
  - `defaultManifest()`, `parseManifest()`, `serialiseManifest()`, `validateManifest()`
  - Collection ref CRUD: `addCollection()`, `removeCollection()`, `updateCollection()`, `getCollection()`
  - Full glossary (Vault/Collection/Manifest/Shell) in `manifest-types.ts` doc comment

### Axed from Legacy

- `WebhookTrigger` / `IntegrationEventTrigger` — Prism uses Tauri IPC, not HTTP endpoints
- `WebhookAction` / `IntegrationAction` — no raw HTTP in Prism architecture
- `FeatureFlagCondition` / `ConfigCondition` — deferred until config system exists
- `IAutomationStore` (async) — simplified to synchronous `AutomationStore` (Loro CRDT is sync)

- `SyncProviderKind` (http/git/dropbox/onedrive/s3) — simplified to peer-based CRDT sync
- `WorkspaceRoster` — deferred; vault discovery is a daemon concern

### Test Summary

- `IConfigStore` (async) — simplified to synchronous `ConfigStore` (Loro CRDT is sync)
- `LocalStorageConfigStore` — browser-specific; Prism uses Tauri IPC
- `FeatureFlagCondition: 'user-role' | 'team-plan' | 'env'` — Prism has no team plans or server env vars

## Phase 19: Identity & Encryption ✅

W3C DIDs and vault-level encryption. Foundation for federation and trust.

- [x] **DID Identity** (`layer1/identity/`)
  - [x] `PrismIdentity` — W3C DID document wrapper (did:web, did:key)
  - [x] `createIdentity()` — generate Ed25519 keypair + DID document
  - [x] `resolveIdentity(did)` — resolve DID to public key and metadata
  - [x] Threshold multi-sig support for shared vault ownership (createMultiSigConfig, createPartialSignature, assembleMultiSignature, verifyMultiSignature)
  - [x] `signPayload()` / `verifySignature()` — Ed25519 sign/verify for CRDT updates
  - [x] Base58btc + multicodec encoding for did:key format
- [x] **Vault Encryption** (`layer1/encryption/`)
  - [x] `VaultKeyManager` — HKDF-derived AES-GCM-256 vault key from identity keypair
  - [x] `encryptSnapshot()` / `decryptSnapshot()` — encrypt Loro snapshots at rest
  - [x] Per-collection encryption with key rotation support (deriveCollectionKey, rotateKey)
  - [x] Secure key storage integration (KeyStore interface for Tauri keychain / Secure Enclave bridge, createMemoryKeyStore for testing)
  - [x] AAD (Additional Authenticated Data) support for binding ciphertext to collection context
  - [x] Standalone encryptSnapshot/decryptSnapshot for one-off encryption without VaultKeyManager

### Implementation Notes

- All crypto via Web Crypto API (SubtleCrypto) — works in Node.js 20+, browsers, Tauri WebView
- Ed25519 for signing (64-byte signatures), AES-GCM-256 for encryption, HKDF-SHA-256 for key derivation
- DID:key uses multibase z-prefix + base58btc + Ed25519 multicodec (0xed01) per W3C spec
- DID:web builds proper `did:web:domain:path` URIs; resolution requires network resolver (interface ready, not yet wired)
- Multi-sig uses threshold scheme: collect N-of-M partial Ed25519 signatures, verify each individually
- Key rotation derives new key from existing material + version-tagged salt — old ciphertext needs old key version

### Files

- `identity-types.ts` — DID, DIDDocument, PrismIdentity, MultiSigConfig, KeyHandle types
- `identity.ts` — createIdentity, resolveIdentity, signPayload, verifySignature, multi-sig functions, base58btc codec
- `encryption-types.ts` — VaultKeyInfo, EncryptedSnapshot, KeyStore, VaultKeyManager types
- `encryption.ts` — createVaultKeyManager, createMemoryKeyStore, standalone encrypt/decrypt

### Test Summary

| Suite | Tests | Status |

  - [x] `createMemoryVfsAdapter()` — in-memory adapter for testing
  - [x] `createLocalVfsAdapter()` — VfsAdapter interface ready; Tauri impl deferred to daemon phase
  - [x] `BinaryRef` — content-addressed reference (SHA-256 hash) stored in GraphObject.data
  - [x] Binary Forking Protocol: acquireLock/releaseLock/replaceLockedFile for non-mergeable files
  - [x] `importFile()` / `exportFile()` — move binaries in/out of vault storage via VfsManager
  - [x] Deduplication via content addressing (same SHA-256 hash = one blob)
  - [x] `computeBinaryHash()` — standalone SHA-256 hash utility

### Implementation Notes

- SHA-256 content addressing via Web Crypto API, hex-encoded (64 chars)
- VfsManager wraps VfsAdapter with lock management + import/export convenience
- Binary Forking Protocol: lock → edit → replaceLockedFile (new blob, moved lock, old preserved) → release
- dispose() clears locks only; blobs persist for history/undo

### Files

- `vfs-types.ts` — BinaryRef, FileStat, BinaryLock, VfsAdapter, VfsManager types
- `vfs.ts` — createMemoryVfsAdapter, createVfsManager, computeBinaryHash

### Test Summary

- [x] **Relay Builder** (`layer1/relay/`)
  - [x] `createRelayBuilder()` — composable builder with `.use()` chaining and `.configure()` overrides
  - [x] `RelayModule` interface — pluggable modules with name/description/dependencies/install/start/stop lifecycle
  - [x] `RelayContext` — shared capability registry for inter-module communication
  - [x] `RelayInstance` — built relay with start/stop lifecycle, capability access, module listing

  - [x] Domain + path resolution for routing requests to portals
  - [x] SSR/AutoREST/Next.js integration deferred to `packages/prism-relay/` runtime package

### Implementation Notes

- Relay is a Layer 1 module (agnostic TS) — the actual server runtime (`packages/prism-relay/`) will import these primitives
- Builder pattern central: `createRelayBuilder({ relayDid }).use(mod1()).use(mod2()).build()`
- "Choose your own adventure": Web 1.0 (just portals), Web 2.0 (portals + webhooks), full (all 7 modules), or custom
- Custom modules implement `RelayModule` interface and register capabilities via `RelayContext`
- All crypto uses existing identity module (Ed25519 signing for timestamps/tokens)
- Zero-knowledge: router sees `RelayEnvelope` with encrypted ciphertext, never plaintext

### Files

- `relay-types.ts` — RelayEnvelope, BlindMailbox, RelayRouter, RelayTimestamper, BlindPinger, CapabilityToken/Manager, WebhookEmitter, PortalRegistry, RelayModule, RelayContext, RelayBuilder, RelayInstance types
- `relay.ts` — createRelayBuilder, 7 module factories, createMemoryPingTransport

### Implementation Notes
- Three execution targets: Sovereign Local, Federated Delegate, External Provider
- Actor types in `actor-types.ts`, AI types in `ai-types.ts` (separate concerns)
- All HTTP calls abstracted behind interfaces (AiHttpClient, SidecarExecutor) — Layer 1 has no runtime dependencies

### Test Summary

| Suite | Tests | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Vitest (studio-kernel) | 23 | Pass |
| Playwright (studio-kernel) | 18 | Written |
| **Phase 30b Total** | **23 Vitest + 18 E2E** | **All Pass** |

## Phase 30c: Studio Canvas + Search + Editor Wiring (Complete)

WYSIWYG preview, search integration, and object-aware editing.

### Completed

- [x] `CanvasPanel` — WYSIWYG page preview rendering page→section→component hierarchy as visual React components
  - Resolves selected page (walks up parentId for child selections)
  - Renders heading/text-block/image/button/card with proper styling

  - Section padding/background from entity data, layout max-width from page data
- [x] `SearchEngine` integration — `kernel.search` indexed against CollectionStore with auto-reindex on changes
- [x] `ObjectExplorer` search — text input filters objects via SearchEngine, flat result list, click to select
- [x] `EditorPanel` object-aware — edits `text-block.data.content` or `heading.data.text` of selected object
  - Per-object LoroText buffers keyed as `obj_content_{id}`
  - Debounced (500ms) sync back to kernel via updateObject
  - Falls back to scratch buffer when nothing editable is selected
- [x] Canvas lens registered (shortcut: v), now 5 lenses total
- [x] E2E tests updated for 5 lenses (shell, keyboard, tabs specs)
- [x] New Playwright tests: canvas preview (4) + search (4)

### Test Summary

| Suite | Tests | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Vitest (studio-kernel) | 23 | Pass |
| Playwright (canvas) | 4 | Written |
| Playwright (search) | 4 | Written |
| **Phase 30c Total** | **23 Vitest + 8 E2E** | **All Pass** |

## Phase 30d: Studio Tier 0 — Kernel Feature Wiring (Complete)

Wired all Layer 1 systems into Studio kernel: Search (already done in 30c), Clipboard, Batch Operations, Activity Tracking, Templates, and LiveView.

### Completed
- [x] **Clipboard** — deep copy/cut/paste with subtree traversal, internal edge preservation, ID remapping
- [x] **Batch Operations** — atomic multi-op (create/update/delete) with single undo entry
- [x] **Activity Tracking** — ActivityStore + TrackableStore adapter for CollectionStore, records create/delete events
- [x] **Templates** — register/list/instantiate with `{{variable}}` interpolation, recursive TemplateNode traversal, edge remapping
- [x] **LiveView** — real-time filtered/sorted views over CollectionStore with type facets and dispose

### Key Decisions
- Clipboard/Batch/Templates implemented directly in kernel using CollectionStore primitives (not TreeModel adapters) — cleaner integration with bus events, undo, and atom sync
- `createTrackableAdapter()` bridges CollectionStore → ActivityTracker's duck-typed `{ get, subscribeObject }` interface
- Template instantiation uses `{{name}}` regex interpolation, matching legacy Helm pattern

### Test Summary

| Suite | Tests | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Vitest (studio-kernel) | 43 | Pass |
| — Clipboard | 4 | Pass |
| — Batch | 3 | Pass |
| — Activity | 3 | Pass |
| — Templates | 5 | Pass |
| — LiveView | 5 | Pass |
| **Phase 30d Total** | **43 Vitest** | **All Pass** |

## Phase 30e: Studio Tier 1 — UI Surface + E2E (Complete)

Surfaced kernel features (clipboard, templates, activity, reorder) in the Studio UI with full Playwright E2E coverage.

### Completed

- [x] **Clipboard UI** — Copy/Cut/Paste buttons in inspector panel + Cmd+C/X/V keyboard shortcuts
  - Inspector shows clipboard section when object selected
  - Paste button disabled when clipboard empty
  - Keyboard shortcuts skip when focus is in input/textarea/contenteditable
- [x] **Template Gallery** — "Templates" button opens gallery overlay
  - Lists registered templates (Blog Post, Landing Page)
  - Click to instantiate with default variables
  - Close button dismisses gallery
- [x] **Activity Feed** — Recent activity section in object explorer sidebar
  - Shows last 10 events from ActivityStore (newest first)

- [x] **Object Reorder** — Move up/down buttons on selected explorer nodes
  - Position swap with sibling above/below
  - Disabled at boundaries (first/last)
  - Tree re-renders reactively via change-counter versioning

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `useSyncExternalStore` version tracking: `allObjects().length` doesn't change on reorder — replaced with monotonic counter refs that increment on every store `onChange`
- Fixed Vite alias resolution: generated per-export aliases from `@prism/core` package.json exports map
- Fixed elkjs `web-worker` resolution: aliased to `elkjs/lib/elk.bundled.js`
- Fixed React 19 infinite loop: `getSnapshot` must return stable primitives, not new arrays/objects

### Test Summary

| Suite | Count | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Vitest (all packages) | 1955 | Pass |
| Playwright — Tier 1 | 18 | Pass |
| — Clipboard UI | 5 | Pass |

  - [x] Portal view routes: `GET /portals`, `GET /portals/:id`, `GET /portals/:id/snapshot.json`
  - [x] Level 2 incremental DOM patching: client-side WS script fetches snapshot JSON and patches `#portal-content` without full-page reload
  - [x] Level 3 interactive forms: `POST /portals/:id/submit` with ephemeral DID auth, capability token verification for non-public portals, form rendering in portal pages
  - [x] Level 4 client-side hydration: `window.__PRISM_PORTAL__` API with subscribe/notify, bidirectional CRDT sync via WebSocket, `sendUpdate()`/`submitObject()` methods

| **Phase 30f Total** | **2089 Vitest + 32 E2E** | **All Pass** |

## Phase 30g: Studio Relay Integration (Complete)

Integrated Prism Relay into Studio as a client-only consumer. Studio has NO server code — it manages relays via CLI and connects to them via HTTP + WebSocket.

### Completed

- [x] **RelayManager** (`relay-manager.ts`) — manages relay connections from Studio
  - Add/remove relay endpoint configurations (name + URL)
  - Connect/disconnect via WebSocket (RelayClient SDK)
  - Status tracking with subscriber notifications
  - URL normalization (http→ws, https→wss, trailing slash stripping)
- [x] **Portal Management** — publish/unpublish/list portals via Relay HTTP API
  - `publishPortal()` — POST manifest to relay, returns view URL
  - `unpublishPortal()` — DELETE portal from relay
  - `listPortals()` — GET all portals on a relay
  - `fetchStatus()` — GET relay health/module info
- [x] **Collection Sync** — push CRDT snapshots to relay for portal rendering
  - Creates hosted collection on relay, imports snapshot via HTTP
  - WebSocket live sync for connected relays
- [x] **Kernel Integration** — `kernel.relay` exposes RelayManager to all Studio components
  - `useRelay()` hook for reactive relay state in React
  - Dispose cleans up all relay connections
- [x] **Relay Lens** (shortcut: r) — 6th Studio lens, "Relay Manager" panel
  - Add Relay form (name + URL, Enter key submit)
  - Relay cards with status dot (green/yellow/red/grey), Connect/Disconnect/Remove
  - Publish Portal dialog (name, level 1-4, base path)
  - Portal list with unpublish and view URL links
  - CLI reference section with all deployment modes
  - Summary counter (relays configured + connected count)
- [x] **E2E Tests** (18 Playwright tests) — full coverage of relay panel UI
  - Panel rendering (header, sections, empty state, CLI reference)
  - Add relay form (inputs, submit, notification, clear, Enter key)
  - Relay card actions (connect guidance, remove, notifications)
  - Multiple relays (add multiple, remove selectively)
  - KBar navigation to Relay panel
  - Summary counter updates
- [x] **Existing E2E updated** — shell (6 icons), tabs (6 lenses), keyboard (6 KBar actions)
- [x] **Injectable HTTP/WS clients** for testing (no real network in unit tests)

### Key Decisions
- Studio is client-only: no server code, Relay servers managed via CLI
- RelayManager uses HTTP fetch for portal CRUD, WebSocket for live sync
- `handleConnect()` shows CLI guidance notification — full WS auth requires daemon identity via Tauri IPC (not yet wired)
- Portal publishing defaults to "default" collection (the kernel's CollectionStore)
- HTTP client and WS client factory are injectable for unit testing

### Test Summary

| Suite | Tests | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Vitest — RelayManager | 21 | Pass |
| Playwright — Relay Panel | 18 | Pass |
| Playwright — Shell (updated) | 8 | Pass |
| Playwright — Tabs (updated) | 5 | Pass |

## Phase 30o: Page Builder Centralization — Tiers 1-2 (Complete)

Connected Studio's page builder panels to the kernel so all state flows through one path (CollectionStore CRDT), not isolated silos.

### Completed

- [x] **1A: Puck ↔ Kernel Bridge** — Rewrote `layout-panel.tsx`:
  - Generates Puck Config dynamically from ObjectRegistry entity defs (component/section categories)
  - Projects kernel objects (page children) into Puck Data format
  - Diffs Puck onChange back into kernel CRUD (create/update/delete)
  - Removed isolated PuckLoroBridge; kernel CollectionStore is now the single source of truth
- [x] **1C: Graph Panel Live Data** — Rewrote `graph-panel.tsx`:
  - Subscribes to `kernel.store.onChange()` for live reactivity
  - Graph rebuilds automatically when objects are created, updated, or deleted
  - No longer snapshot-only at mount time
- [x] **2A: Drag-Drop in Explorer** — Added to `object-explorer.tsx`:
  - HTML5 drag-drop on tree nodes for reorder (above/below) and reparent (on)
  - Containment rule validation via `registry.canBeChildOf()`
  - Drop indicators (blue border top/bottom, highlight for reparent)

## Phase 32: Facets — FileMaker Pro-Inspired Builder System

Visual projection + automation builder system. "Facet" = a face of a prism = a visual projection of collection data. Non-programmers can design forms, lists, tables, reports, scripts, and calculations without writing code.

### Architecture

Three tiers:
1. **Tier 1** (exists): ObjectRegistry, CollectionStore, ExpressionEngine, AutomationEngine, ViewConfig, Luau Runtime
2. **Tier 2** (Layer 1 engines): FacetParser, FacetSchema, SpellEngine, ProseCodec, Sequencer types, Emitters
3. **Tier 3** (Layer 2 React): FormFacet, TableFacet, ReportFacet, Sequencer UI, LuauFacet, FacetBuilders

### Naming Map (Legacy Helm → Prism Facets)

| Legacy | Prism | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Document Surface modes | Facet (FormFacet, ListFacet, TableFacet, ReportFacet) | Visual projections |
| Wizards (Condition/Script) | Sequencer | Visual automation builder |
| Form Parser | FacetParser | YAML/JSON ↔ typed field records |
| Codegen Writers | Emitters (TS/JS/C#/Luau/JSON/YAML/TOML) | Schema → multi-language output |
| Spellcheck Engine | SpellEngine | Text quality across all facets |
| Luau View Renderer | LuauFacet | Custom facets authored in Luau |

  - [x] Task list support (`- [ ]`, `- [x]`)
- [x] **Sequencer types** — port legacy wizard data model + Luau emission
