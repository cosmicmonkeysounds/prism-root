# @prism/core

Client-side execution environment — Layer 1 (agnostic TS) + Layer 2 (React renderers).

## Build
- `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm test` / `pnpm test:watch`

## Architecture
- **Layer 1**: Object Model (GraphObject, ObjectRegistry, TreeModel, EdgeModel, WeakRefEngine, ContextEngine, NSID), Lens System (LensRegistry, ShellStore), Plugin System (PrismPlugin, PluginRegistry, ContributionRegistry), Reactive Atoms (PrismBus, AtomStore, ObjectAtomStore, bus-to-atom bridges), State Machines (Machine, createMachine — flat FSM with guards/actions/lifecycle), Graph Analysis (dependency graph, topological sort, cycle detection, blocking chains, slip impact), Planning Engine (CPM — critical path, early/late start/finish, float), Input System (KeyboardModel, InputScope, InputRouter), Layout System (SelectionModel, PageModel, PageRegistry, WorkspaceSlot, WorkspaceManager), Forms & Validation (FieldSchema, DocumentSchema, FormState, wiki-links, markdown), Expression Engine (Scanner, Parser, Evaluator), Automation Engine (AutomationEngine, triggers/conditions/actions, condition evaluator, template interpolation), Manifest (PrismManifest — weak references to Collections inside a Vault, StorageConfig, SchemaConfig, SyncConfig, CollectionRef), Config System (ConfigRegistry, ConfigModel, FeatureFlags — layered scope resolution: default→workspace→user), Undo/Redo (UndoRedoManager — snapshot-based undo with merge/batch, createUndoBridge for auto-recording TreeModel/EdgeModel mutations), Server Factory (generateRouteSpecs, buildOpenApiDocument — framework-agnostic REST route generation + OpenAPI 3.1.0 from ObjectRegistry), CRDT Persistence (CollectionStore — Loro-backed object/edge storage with filtering and sync, VaultManager — manifest-driven collection lifecycle with PersistenceAdapter), Search Engine (SearchIndex — TF-IDF inverted index with field-weighted scoring, SearchEngine — cross-collection search orchestrator with structured filters, facets, pagination, live subscriptions), Vault Discovery (VaultRoster — persistent registry of known vaults with sort/pin/search/persistence, VaultDiscovery — filesystem scanning for .prism.json manifests with roster merge and discovery events), Zustand stores, Loro bridge, Lua runtime (wasmoon), XState machines
- **Layer 2**: CodeMirror 6 (LoroText sync), Puck (Loro layout), KBar (focus-depth), Spatial Graph (@xyflow/react + elkjs), Shell (ShellLayout, ActivityBar, TabBar, LensProvider)
- Loro CRDT is the hidden buffer. Editors project Loro state.
- Zustand stores subscribe to specific Loro node IDs (atomic)

- `@prism/core/graph-analysis` — Dependency Graph (topological sort, cycle detection, blocking chains, slip impact) + Planning Engine (CPM critical path method)
- `@prism/core/automation` — Automation Engine (triggers, conditions, actions, condition evaluator, template interpolation, cron scheduling)
- `@prism/core/manifest` — Prism Manifest (weak references to Collections in a Vault; StorageConfig, SchemaConfig, SyncConfig, CollectionRef, parse/serialise/validate). See manifest-types.ts for Vault/Collection/Manifest/Shell glossary.
- `@prism/core/config` — Config System (ConfigRegistry, ConfigModel, FeatureFlags, validateConfig, coerceConfigValue, schemaToValidator, MemoryConfigStore). Layered scope resolution: default → workspace → user. Built-in settings for ui/editor/sync/ai/notifications.
